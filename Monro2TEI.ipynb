      "<p><strong>1.</strong> All language of which grammar takes cognizance consists of sentences. The simplest complete sentence expresses the combination of a subject—that about which we speak (or think); and a predicate—that which we say (or think) about the subject. On the sentences which are (apparently or really) without a subject, see §§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/uses-nominative\" target=\"_blank\">161 and 163</a></strong>.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>2.</strong> In Greek (and generally in languages whose structure resembles that of Greek) every verb is a complete sentence, consisting of two parts, the stem, which expresses the predicate, and the ending, which expresses the subject. Thus ἔσ-τι <i>he</i> (or <i>it</i>) <em>is</em>, <foreign>φα-θί</foreign> <i>say you</i>, ἤλθο-μεν <i>we came</i>, are sentences; the several predicates are expressed by the stems ἐσ-, φα-, ἠλθο-, and the subjects by the endings -τι, -θι, -μεν. As the endings of a verb may always be translated by personal pronouns they are called the personal endings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It may happen that the ending has been lost by phonetic corruption, as in ἔλαβε (for ἐλαβε-τ) <i>he took</i>. This however does not form a real exception, because in Greek such words are used exactly as if the lost ending were still sounded. In English it is different: <i>took</i> can only be used to express a predicate. The original subject is lost to the mind as well as to the ear.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It should be noticed that the term \"verb\" is used in grammars with a double meaning, sometimes of a single form—as when we say that ἐτύπτο-μεν is \"a verb\"—sometimes collectively, as when we say that ἐτύπτο-μεν is a \"part\" of \"the verb\" <foreign>τύπτω.</foreign> Here \"a verb\" means a group of forms, derived from a common root.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>3.</strong> There are three main sets of personal endings</p>\n",
      "<list rend=\"numbered\">\n",
      "<item>Those used in the tenses called \"principal\" (the present, perfect, and future indicative), and in the subjunctive; these are called the primary endings.</item>\n",
      "<item>Those used in the \"historical tenses\" (the imperfect, aorist, and pluperfect), and in the optative; these are called the secondary endings.</item>\n",
      "<item>The endings of the imperative.</item>\n",
      "</list>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>4.</strong> The further modifications which the endings undergo depend chiefly upon the final letter of the stem.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In certain forms the ending is preceded by Ο or Ε: that is to say, Ο before the nasals μ, ν, and Ε before other letters; e.g. <foreign>τύπτο-μεν</foreign>, <foreign>τύπτε-τε</foreign>, <foreign>τύπτο-ντι</foreign> (older and Doric form of <foreign>τύπτουσι</foreign>). We shall call this the <term>thematic vowel</term>,\n",
      "\n",
      "    <note n=\"1\"><p>This vowel has also been termed the \"connecting\" or \"auxiliary\" vowel—names given on the supposition that it is originally euphonic, inserted in order to allow the stem and the ending to be distinctly heard in pronunciation. The name \"thematic\" implies a different theory; viz. that it serves to form a \"theme\" from a simpler element or \"root,\" as <foreign>λεγ-ε</foreign> from the root <foreign>λεγ-;</foreign> see Curt. <i>Chron.</i> p. 40. On this theory the stem <foreign>λεγ-ε</foreign>, <foreign>λεγ-ο</foreign> is originally the same as the theme or stem of the noun <foreign>λόγο-ς.</foreign> See the remarks of Brugmann, <i>Grundriss</i>, ii. § 8, n. 1.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <p>In the former edition the -ω of the 1st sing. was explained as -ο-μι (Sanskrit <i>-ᾱ-mi</i>). It is now generally thought that -ω and -μι are originally distinct, and represent respectively the thematic and athematic endings of the primitive Indo-European verb. If so, the Sanskrit <i>-āmι</i> has extended from the athematic to the thematic conjugation; and similarly the -ομαι of Greek <foreign>φέρομαι</foreign> (Sanskrit <i>bhare</i>). See Meyer, <i>G. G.</i> p.404.</p></note>\n",
      "\n",
      " and the stems which contain it <i>thematic stems</i>. The term will naturally include the corresponding subjunctives, in which the final letter of the stem varies in the same way between η and ω, as <foreign>τύπτω-μεν</foreign>, <foreign>τύπτη-τε</foreign>, etc., and the 1st singular in -ω. These long vowels doubtless represent a primitive contraction of the thematic vowel with some other element: but the exact process can hardly be determined.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The forms which do not contain this variable ε or ο are called <term>athematic</term>. Among these, again, we have to distinguish a group of tenses with stems ending in -ᾰ, viz. the perfect, the 1st aorist, and some forms peculiar to the Ionic dialect, as the pluperfect (<i>e. g.</i> ᾔδεα <i>I knew</i>), the imperfect ἦα <i>I was</i>, ἤϊα <i>I went</i>. In these stems the -ᾰ changes in the 3rd singular to -ε(ν).<note n=\"2\">The ᾰ of these stems is of course quite different from the final vowel of the stem in such forms as <foreign>φα-μέν</foreign>, ἵστα-μαι, <foreign>τέτλα-θι</foreign>, where it is part of the verb stem or &amp;quot;root&amp;quot;.</note>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The distinction between thematic and athematic applies in strictness only to forms, but may generally be extended to tenses and moods. Thus the present and imperfect of <foreign>τύπτω</foreign> are thematic, the <a name=\"five\"></a>same tenses of <foreign>φημί</foreign> are athematic. In every verb the future is thematic, the optative is athematic, etc. But the distinction does not apply to \"verbs\" (in the collective sense of the term), because almost every verb is made up of forms of both kinds.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>5.</strong> In the following table of the personal endings found in Homer the endings distinguished by larger type are those of the athematic tenses. The endings in smaller type are, first, those of the forms with ᾰ, and, under them again, those of the thematic forms. In the dual and plural (except the 3rd plural) the endings are the same throughout.</p>\n",

Cobet maintains the same view (<i>Misc. Crit. </i>pp. 279 ff.). But the account of the Greek grammarians is strikingly borne out by the forms of the Sanskrit dual. In Sanskrit we find that in the historical tenses the 2nd dual ends in <i>-tam</i>, 3rd dual in <i>-tâm</i>, answering perfectly to the Greek -τον, -την. This, therefore, is to be regarded as the original rule. The exceptions which have been quoted are evidently due to the tendency towards uniformity: and it is to be noticed that this tendency seems to have acted in Homer in the direction of making all duals end in -τον, -σθον, whereas in Attic the tendency was to extend the endings -την, -σθην to the 2nd person.</item>\n",

Again, the 2nd singular ἔησθα and 3rd singular ἔην, ἤην seem to require a stem (ἐ)ση-, found also in Latin <i>e-rām</i> (Brugmann, <i>M.U.</i> i. p.35), The -ν of the 3rd singular is unexplained: it does not appear to be the <foreign>ν ἐφελκυστικόν</foreign>, for we find no form *ἦε alongside of ἦεν.</p>\n",

      "<p>The Homeric forms of <foreign>εἰμί</foreign> were discussed some years ago by L. Meyer (<i>Κ. Ζ.</i> ix. pp. 385, 423). He maintained that the Homeric 3rd singular imperfect was ἦεν or (without augment) ἔεν: the forms ἦν, ἔην and ἤην being due to corruption or misreading. The facts certainly give much countenance to this view, which has been adopted by Curtius (<i>Stud.</i> i. 2, 292) and Nauck. It can hardly be accidental that out of 54 places in which ἦν occurs in the thesis or second half of the foot, there are 50 in which it is followed by a vowel.</p>\n",

      "<p>Moreover, out of 72 instances of ἔην there are 63 in which it is followed by a consonant (including ϝ). On the other hand, in 26 places ἦν occurs in the first half of the foot, and in 2 places it ends the line (in the phrase <foreign>οὐδʼ ἄρα πως ἦν</foreign>); and it is not easy to correct many of these so as to admit ἦεν or ἔεν. Again, ἦν and ἔην have some support in the 2nd singular forms ἦσθα, ἔησθα. (For ἔησθα Curtius proposed ἔεσθα, but there is no good reason for this.) And ἔην is found on an Ionic inscription of the 5th century (Röhl, no. 382). On the whole it seems that the argument for ἔεν is stronger than the argument against ἦν and ἔην. Perhaps we must recognize two stems, giving four forms: a stem ἐσ-, whence ἦεν, without augment ἔεν, and a stem (ἐ)ση- (Latin <i>e-rām</i>), whence ἔ-ην, without augment ἦν. The rare ἤην occurs followed by a vowel (so that we cannot read ἦεν) in 3 places only, viz. <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg002:19.283\">Od. 19.283</bibl> (al. <foreign>εἴη</foreign>, ἤειν), 23.316, 24.343.

In these and many similar cases \"metathesis\" is out of the question. Moreover we find several stems of the same character with the long vowel ῡ as ῥῦ-σθαι <i>to shield</i> (ϝρῡ-), ῥῡ-τός <i>drawn</i> (ϝερῠ-, ϝρῡ-), <foreign>τρῡ́-ω</foreign> (cp. <foreign>τρ-η</foreign>-, root <i>tar</i>). Hence it is probable that the long vowel is of the nature of a suffix, by which a new verbal stem is formed from the primitive stem or \"root\". This vowel usually does not vary with the personal endings, but is long in all forms of the tense. It cannot be an accident, however, that the same stems appear also as disyllables with a short final vowel: <foreign>τᾰλ-ᾰ</foreign>, <foreign>πελ-ᾰ</foreign>, <foreign>στορ-ε</foreign>, <foreign>καλ-ε</foreign> (in <foreign>καλέ-σαι</foreign>), <foreign>γεν-ε</foreign> (in <foreign>γένε-σις</foreign>), <foreign>δᾰμ-ᾰ</foreign>, <foreign>πετ-ᾰ</foreign>, ϝερ-ῠ in ἐρύ-σαι, and many others. What then is the relation between these forms and the monosyllabic <foreign>τλ-η</foreign>, <foreign>πλ-η</foreign>, <foreign>στρ-ω</foreign>, <foreign>κλ-η</foreign>, <foreign>γν-η</foreign>, <foreign>δμ-η</foreign>, <foreign>πτ-η?</foreign><a name=\"one-five\"></a>Apparently the difference is ultimately one of accent.

Thus ἔ-χευ-α is formed like ἔ-φη-ν, except that, after the diphthong ευ the final -<i>m</i> of the ending passed into -ᾰ, as in the imperfect ἦα (for ἦσ-α). So too in the accusative of nouns we have -ν after a single vowel (λόγο-ν, <foreign>πόλι-ν</foreign>, ἰχθύ-ν), but -ᾰ after ηυ, ευ or a consonant: <foreign>νῆ-α</foreign> (for <foreign>νηῦ-α</foreign> or <foreign>νῆϝ-α</foreign>), <foreign>πόδ-α</foreign>, as in Latin <i>nāv-em</i>, <i>ped-em</i>. The forms without υ, as ἔχεα, ἔκηα, are obtained by υ passing into the semi-vowel (ἔχε-α for ἔχεϝα).</p>\n",

Thus ἔ-χευα-ς, ἐ-χεύα-μεν, ἐ-χεύα-το are duplicate forms, related to ἔ-χευ-ς, ἔ-χῠ-μεν, ἔ-χυ-το as the later <foreign>οἶδα-ς</foreign>, <foreign>οἴδᾰ-μεν</foreign> to <foreign>οἶσθα</foreign>, ἴδ-μεν.

      "<p>These forms cannot be explained by the ordinary contraction with the thematic ε or ο, <i>e .g.</i> <foreign>φοιτή-την</foreign> cannot come from *φοι-ταέτην, <foreign>φορῆ-ναι</foreign> from *φορεέ-ναι, ἀλιτή-μενος from *ἀλιτεό-μενος, <foreign>σάω</foreign> from <foreign>σάοε</foreign>, etc. On the other hand, as Curtius has shown (<i>Stud.</i> iii. 377-401, <i>Verb.</i> i. 352 ff.), they agree exactly with those athematic forms in which the vowel before the ending is long except before -ντ and -ι, such as the present <foreign>κιχή-μεναι</foreign>, ἀή-μεναι (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/simple-athematic-present#one-two\" target=\"_blank\">12</a></strong>), the aorist <foreign>στή-μεναι</foreign>, <foreign>τλῆ-ναι</foreign>, <foreign>γνώ-μεναι</foreign>, etc., and (as we may add by anticipation) the passive aorists in -ην and -θην.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Moreover, the same type of inflection appears in the peculiar verbs in -μι of the Aeolic dialect, as <foreign>φίλη-μι</foreign>, 1st plural <foreign>φίλη-μεν</foreign>, 3rd plural <foreign>φίλεισι</foreign> (for <foreign>φίλε-ντι</foreign>), participle <foreign>φιλή-μενος;</foreign> and also in the Latin verbs in <i>-āre</i> and <i>-ēre</i>, except in the 1st singular; e.g. <i>amā-mini</i> is parallel to ἀρή-μεναι, <i>docemini</i> to <foreign>φορή-μεναι</foreign>, <i>docemus</i>, <i>doce-nt</i> to <foreign>φίλη-μεν</foreign>, <foreign>φίλεισι.</foreign></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Further traces of this formation may be seen in those Attic verbs in -αω and -οω which take η and ω instead of ᾱ and ου respectively (as <foreign>ζάω</foreign>, <foreign>ζῇς</foreign>, ζῇ, etc., ῥιγόω, inf. ῥιγῶν), and in the optative in -ῳην, -οιην (for which however in the case of verbs in -εω we expect -ειην, as in <foreign>κιχείην</foreign> and Aeolic <foreign>φιλείη</foreign>).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These facts seem to show that the formation now in question is of high antiquity, and Curtius even maintained that it was older than the ordinary conjugation of the verbs in -ᾰω, -εω, -οω. In these verbs, as he pointed out, there is evidence to show that the vowel before the thematic ending was originally long (e.g. in Homeric <foreign>διψᾱ́ων</foreign>, <foreign>πεινᾱ́ων</foreign>, ὑπνώοντες, Aeolic <foreign>ποθήω</foreign>, ἀδικήει, etc.). The forms in -ᾱω, -ηω, -ωω, again, may represent an older (and Aeolic) -ᾱμι, -ημι, -ωμι, just as <foreign>δεικνύω</foreign> is for older <foreign>δείκνῡμι;</foreign> and these again may be explained by contraction from -ᾱι̯ημι, -ηι̯ημι, -ωι̯ημι, the Greek representatives of the Sanskrit <i>-ayâmi</i>. The Latin <i>amo</i>, <i>doceo</i>, pl. <i>amāmus</i>, <i>docēmus</i>, would fall into this scheme, if we suppose that they belong to the stage at which the thematic endings had not extended beyond the 1st singular.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Against this theory it is urged by Brugmann (<i>M. U.</i> i. 86) that the thematic conjugation of these verbs is found also in Sanskrit, Zend, Slavo-Lithuanian and Germanic—all which members of the Indo-European family, if Curtius is right, must have recast their derivative verbs on the same thematic model. It is more probable therefore that these verbs were originally thematic, and according to the final vowel of the base appeared as verbs in -αω (as <foreign>νικά-ω</foreign>), -εω (as <foreign>ποθέ-ω</foreign>), or -οω (as <foreign>δηϊό-ω</foreign>). On this assumption, again, the Homeric forms now in question may be variously explained. Where we find η for εε or αε, as in <foreign>φιλήμεναι</foreign>, <foreign>γοήμεναι</foreign> (instead of the ει, ᾱ required by the ordinary rules), we may suppose, with Wackernagel (<i>K. Z.</i> xxvii. 84), that the contraction belongs to an earlier (pre-Hellenic) period. The existence of such a period is proved (e. g.) by the temporal augment, as in ἦ(σ)α for an original ἐ-εσα. Then the participles ἀλιτήμενος, <foreign>φιλήμενος</foreign> and the like may be explained by supposing a form in -εμενος, cp. Latin <i>leg-imini</i>, <i>docēmini</i>, so that <foreign>φιλήμενος</foreign> would be a primitive contraction from <foreign>φιλε-έμενος</foreign> (φιλε-ι̯ε-μενος). The solution however is confessedly incomplete. It does not (directly at least) explain Aeolic <foreign>φίλημεν</foreign>, <foreign>φίλεισι</foreign>, Latin <i>amāmus</i>, <i>docēmus</i>, <i>amant</i>, <i>docent</i>. It only explains the long vowel of <foreign>φιλή-σω</foreign>, ἐφίλη-σα, <foreign>φιλητός</foreign>, etc., if we also suppose that the -ι̯ε of the present was carried through all the tenses. And it does not give any satisfactory account of the common contracted forms, <foreign>νικᾶτε</foreign>, <foreign>φιλεῖτε</foreign>, <foreign>δηλοῦτε</foreign>, etc., since these must have come from <foreign>νικάετε</foreign>, <foreign>φιλέετε</foreign>, <foreign>δηλόετε</foreign>, etc., at a period in which the ordinary Greek rules of contraction were in force.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A wholly different explanation is proposed by Brugmann himself (l. c.). He shows, as we have seen (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/simple-athematic-aorist#one-four\" target=\"_blank\">14</a></strong>), that there is a large class of athematic forms with stems ending in a long vowel–ᾱ, η, ω–which is of the nature of a suffix. Such are ἔ-βλ-η-ν (βᾰλ-, <foreign>βλ-η</foreign>), ἔ-πτη-ν (πετ-, <foreign>πτ-η</foreign>), ἔ-γνω-ν (γεν-, <foreign>γν-ω</foreign>-), and many others, which have their representatives in all languages of the Indo-European family. By an extension of this type has been formed the specifically Greek class of the passive aorists in -ην, as ἔ-φανη-ν, ἐ-τύπη-ν and one or two in -ων, as ἑ-άλω-ν.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Similarly, again, the analogy of the verbs in -μι, and especially of those tenses which do not vary the quantity of the stem (as <foreign>κίχημι</foreign>, ἄημι, <foreign>πλῆ-το</foreign>, ἔγνων) has affected the derivative verbs, and has thus produced the athematic forms in question—φιλήμεναι like ἀήμεναι, ἀλιτήμενος like <foreign>κιχήμενος</foreign>, and so on. The forms <foreign>τιθή-μεναι</foreign> (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:23.83\">Il. 23.83</bibl> &amp; 247), <foreign>τιθή-μενον</foreign> (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:10.34\">Il. 10.34</bibl>) are probably due to the influence of the same group of verbs. A similar process explains the Aeolic conjugation of verbs in -μι (γέλαιμι, <foreign>φίλημι</foreign>, <foreign>δοκίμωμι</foreign>), the difference being that in Aeolic it was carried much further. In Homer we have nothing answering to the 1st singular <foreign>φίλημι</foreign>, the 1st plural <foreign>φίλημεν</foreign>, the 3rd plural <foreign>φίλεισι</foreign>, or the corresponding imperfect forms.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We cannot be sure, however, that all the examples of this type which appeared in the original text of Homer have been preserved. Wackernagel has observed that nearly all the words now in question are forms which would be unfamiliar in the Greece of classical times. The list is made up chiefly of duals (προσαυδήτην, <foreign>φοιτήτην</foreign>, etc.) and infinitives in -μεναι. It is not improbable (e g.) that the familiar form <foreign>προσηύδα</foreign> has supplanted an original athematic <foreign>προσηύδη.</foreign> On the other hand in <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:11.639\">Il. 11.639</bibl> ἐπὶ <foreign>δʼ αἴγειον κνῆ τυρόν</foreign> the meter points rather to the uncontracted <foreign>κνάε.</foreign></p>\n",

      "<p>Stems which take the suffix <foreign>κ*.</foreign><note n=\"9\">A word may be said here on the origin of the perfects in -κᾰ. They may be regarded as formed in the ordinary way from stems in which a root has been lengthened by a suffixed κ, as in ὀλέ-κ-ω, ἐρύ-κ-ω (§ 45), <foreign>πτήσσω</foreign> (for <foreign>πτη-κ-ι̯ω</foreign>, cp. ἔ-πτα-κ-ον), <foreign>δειδίσσομαι</foreign> (for <foreign>δει-δϝικ-ι̯ο-μαι</foreign>). Thus ὀλώλεκα is the regular perfect of ὀλέκω, and <foreign>πέπτωκα</foreign>, <foreign>δείδοικα</foreign>, answer to the weak stems <foreign>πτᾰ-κ</foreign>-, <foreign>δϝῐ-κ-.</foreign> So <foreign>βέβηκα</foreign>, ἕστηκα answer to (possible) presents *βή-κω (cp. <foreign>βάκ-τρον</foreign>), *στή-κω. It is not necessary to suppose an actual stem in κ in each case; a few instances would serve to create the type. The reason for the use of the longer stems <foreign>βη-κ</foreign>, <foreign>στη-κ</foreign>, etc., was probably that the forms given by the original stems were too unlike other perfects. The characteristic -ᾰ would be lost by contraction with the preceding vowels. It is a confirmation of this view that the stem with -κα is in the same form as the present stems with a suffixed κ, γ, θ (§ 45), or σκ (§ 48). A similar theory may be formed of the perfects in -θα, of which the germs have been mentioned above. <foreign>βέβρω-θα</foreign> is related to a part. <foreign>βεβρω-ώς</foreign> (§ 26.4) as <foreign>τέθνη-κα</foreign> to <foreign>τεθνη-ώς</foreign>, and to a mid. *βέβρω-μαι (cp <foreign>βεβρώ-σεται</foreign>) as <foreign>βέβλη-κα</foreign> to <foreign>βέβλη-μαι.</foreign> If in a few more cases, such as <foreign>βέβρῑ-θα</foreign> (βρῐ-), <foreign>εἴωθα</foreign> (suē-tus), <foreign>γέγη-θα</foreign> (γαϝ-ιω), we had had short forms of the stem without -θ-, the suffix -θα would have been felt to characterize the perfect active; that is to say, the type of the &amp;quot;Perfect in -θα&amp;quot; would have been created, and might have spread as the perfect in -κα has done. The aorists in -κᾰ are to be accounted for in the same way. The κ may be traced in the present <foreign>δώκω</foreign> (on the inscription of Idalion, see Curt. Stud.vii. 243) and in the noun <foreign>θήκ-η</foreign>, which points to a verb stem <foreign>θη-κ-.</foreign> </note></p>\n",

      "<item><a class=\"footnote-label\" href=\"#footnoteref9_cjcml1p\">9</a>A word may be said here on the origin of the perfects in -κᾰ. They may be regarded as formed in the ordinary way from stems in which a root has been lengthened by a suffixed κ, as in ὀλέ-κ-ω, ἐρύ-κ-ω (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/thematic-present-suffix\" target=\"_blank\">45</a></strong>), <foreign>πτήσσω</foreign> (for <foreign>πτη-κ-ι̯ω</foreign>, cp. ἔ-πτα-κ-ον), <foreign>δειδίσσομαι</foreign> (for <foreign>δει-δϝικ-ι̯ο-μαι</foreign>). Thus ὀλώλεκα is the regular perfect of ὀλέκω, and <foreign>πέπτωκα</foreign>, <foreign>δείδοικα</foreign>, answer to the weak stems <foreign>πτᾰ-κ</foreign>-, <foreign>δϝῐ-κ-.</foreign> So <foreign>βέβηκα</foreign>, ἕστηκα answer to (possible) presents *βή-κω (cp. <foreign>βάκ-τρον</foreign>), *στή-κω. It is not necessary to suppose an actual stem in κ in each case; a few instances would serve to create the type. The reason for the use of the longer stems <foreign>βη-κ</foreign>, <foreign>στη-κ</foreign>, etc., was probably that the forms given by the original stems were too unlike other perfects. The characteristic -ᾰ would be lost by contraction with the preceding vowels. It is a confirmation of this view that the stem with -κα is in the same form as the present stems with a suffixed κ, γ, θ (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/thematic-present-suffix\" target=\"_blank\">45</a></strong>), or σκ (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/thematic-present-suffix#four-eight\" target=\"_blank\">48</a></strong>). A similar theory may be formed of the perfects in -θα, of which the germs have been mentioned above. <foreign>βέβρω-θα</foreign> is related to a part. <foreign>βεβρω-ώς</foreign> (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/perfect-participle#two-six-point-four\" target=\"_blank\">26.4</a></strong>) as <foreign>τέθνη-κα</foreign> to <foreign>τεθνη-ώς</foreign>, and to a mid. *βέβρω-μαι (cp <foreign>βεβρώ-σεται</foreign>) as <foreign>βέβλη-κα</foreign> to <foreign>βέβλη-μαι.</foreign> If in a few more cases, such as <foreign>βέβρῑ-θα</foreign> (βρῐ-), <foreign>εἴωθα</foreign> (<i>suē-tus</i>), <foreign>γέγη-θα</foreign> (γαϝ-ιω), we had had short forms of the stem without -θ-, the suffix -θα would have been felt to characterize the perfect active; that is to say, the type of the \"Perfect in -θα\" would have been created, and might have spread as the perfect in -κα has done.<br />\n",
      " The aorists in -κᾰ are to be accounted for in the same way. The κ may be traced in the present <foreign>δώκω</foreign> (on the inscription of Idalion, see <i>Curt. Stud.</i>vii. 243) and in the noun <foreign>θήκ-η</foreign>, which points to a verb stem <foreign>θη-κ-.</foreign> </item>\n",

      "<p><i>Note</i>: The present ἀκούω <i>I hear</i> appears to be originally a perfect which has gone through the process exemplified. The true present form is ἀκεύω, which survived in Cyprus (ἀκεύει· <foreign>τηρεῖ Κύπριοι</foreign>) and Crete (<i>Law of Gortyn</i> ii. 17). Hence the Attic ἀκήκοα (for ἀκήκουα), and presumably also an earlier form *ἄκουα, formed like ἄνωγα, and passing into ἀκούω as ἄνωγα passed into ἀνώγω. This explains the use of ἀκούω with the perfect meaning (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/meanings-present-stem#seven-two-point-four\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>72.4</strong></a>), which accordingly is not quite parallel to the similar use of <foreign>πυνθάνομαι</foreign>, <foreign>μανθάνω</foreign>, etc. Other Homeric examples are <foreign>διώκω</foreign> (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/thematic-present\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>29</strong></a>), in which the want of reduplication may be original (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/perfect#two-three-point-five\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>23.5</strong></a>) and ἱλήκω (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/perfect#two-two-point-nine-b\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>22.9.b</strong></a>). The form ἥκω, which is probably of this nature, occurs in our MSS. of Homer (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:5.473\">Il. 5.473</bibl>, 18.406; <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg002:13.325\">Od. 13.325</bibl>, 15.329), but Bekker substituted the undoubtedly Homeric ἵκω (La Roche, <i>H.

      "<p>The form ἐνένιπε <i>rebuked</i>, which occurs several times in Homer (usually with the variants ἐνένιπτε and ἐνένισπε), should perhaps be placed here. It is usually classed as a reduplicated aorist (so Curt. <i>Verb</i>. ii 26), but there is no analogy for this, and the Homeric passages do not prove that it is an aorist. The ῑ of the stem may be due to the influence of the present ἐνίπτω and the noun ἐνῑπή (cp. § <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/perfect#two-five-point-three\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>25.3</strong></a>). Buttman acutely compared it with ἐπέπληγον, which is evidently related to <foreign>πλήσσω</foreign> and <foreign>πληγή</foreign> as ἐνένῑπον to ἐνίπτω (ἐνίσσω) and ἐνῑπή.The reduplication is of the type of ἐρέριπτο.</p>\n",

This transition is seen (e. g.) in ἐχάρη <i>rejoiced</i>, ἐδάη <i>learned</i>, ῥύη <i>flowed</i>, ἐφάνη <i>appeared</i>. In these instances the passive grows out of the intransitive meaning (as in the middle forms it grows out of the reflexive meaning). Similar transitions of meaning may be found in the perfect (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/meaning-perfect\" target=\"_blank\">28, fin.</a></strong>), the aorist (ἔσβη <i>was quenched</i>), and even in the present, as ἐκπίπτειν <i>to be driven out</i>, <foreign>κεῖται</foreign> <i>is laid down</i> (as perfect middle of <foreign>τίθημι</foreign>), and <foreign>πάσχω</foreign> itself.</p>\n",

      "<p>This observation has recently suggested a very probable account of the origin of the aorist in -θη-ν. The 2nd singular middle ending in Sanskrit is <i>-thās</i>, to which would correspond Greek -θης. Hence the original inflection was (e .g.) ἐ-λύ-μην, ἐ-λύ-θης, ἔ-λυ-το, etc. Then ἐλύθης was regarded as ἐ-λύθη-ς, that is to say, <foreign>λυθη</foreign>- was taken as the tense stem, and the inflection was completed on the model of the already formed aorists in -ην (Wackernagel, l.c.).</p>\n",

      "<p>The aorists in -η-ν and -θη-ν are formations peculiar to Greek, and were doubtless developed along with the separation of present and aorist forms which had hardly been completed in the time of Homer (Curtius, <i>Verb.</i> ii. 1 ff.). It is worth notice that the three aorists that have a distinctive suffix agree in avoiding the thematic endings, while the imperfect. tends to adopt them, as in ἐτίθει, ἐδίδου, ὤμνυε, etc. The reason doubtless was that the thematic inflection already prevailed in the present. Thus a distinction of form was gained which was especially needed for the aorists in -η-ν. Forms like ἐφίλει (which at first, as we see from <foreign>φιλή-μεναι</foreign>, subsisted side by side with ἐφίλη) were adopted as imperfects, while ἐμίγη etc., were retained as aorists.</p>\n",

      "<item>These forms were regarded by the older grammarians as the result of a process called \"distraction,\" (the exact reverse of contraction), by which a long vowel, ᾱ or ω, could be separated into two distinct vowels (ᾰᾱ, οω, etc.). The first attempt to account for them in a more rational way was made by L. Meyer (<em>K. Z.</em> x. 45 ff.). According to him they represent an intermediate stage in the process of contraction. The order, he argued, is ὁράω—ὁρόω—ὁρῶ: i.e. in ὁρόω the α has been assimilated to the following ω, but is not yet uttered in one breath with it. In the forms ὁρόωντες, ὁρόωσι, etc., he pointed out that the long vowel is never wanted for the meter, and accordingly he wished to read ὁρόοντες, ὁρόουσι, etc. To this last proposal exception was taken by G. Curtius (<em>Erläuterungen</em>, p. 96), who made the counter supposition that, as the α of these verbs was originally long, the successive steps might be ὁρᾱ́οντες, ὁρώοντες and (by metathesis of quantity) ὁρόωντες. The stage -ωο- is exemplified in <foreign>μνωόμενος.</foreign></item>\n",
      "<item>The main objection to this theory lies in the circumstance that the forms ὁρόω, ὁράᾳς and the like are exclusively \"epic,\" that is to say, they are confined to Homer, Hesiod, and their direct imitators. If they had been created by any natural development of Greek sounds, we should expect to find them in other dialects. But neither in Ionic nor elsewhere is there any trace of their existence in living speech. It must be admitted, too, that neither Meyer nor Curtius has given a satisfactory account of the long vowel in ὁρόωσι, ὁρόωντο, ὁρόωντες, etc. A form ὁρόοντες, as Curtius pointed out, would give ὁροῦντες, not ὁρῶντες. And if there has been metathesis of quantity, why do we never find ὁρόωμεν for ὁρᾱ́ομεν, or ὁράᾱτε for ὁρᾱ́ετε?</item>\n",
      "<item>An entirely different theory was put forward by J. Wackernagel (<em>Bezz. Beitr.</em>iv. 259). The true Homeric forms, in his view, are the original uncontracted ὁράω, ὁράεις, etc., and these have passed into the ὁρόω, ὁράᾳς, etc., of our Homer by a process of textual corruption consisting of two stages:<br />\n",

      "<p>2. restoration of the meter by a kind of \"distraction\" (in the old sense of the term), i.e. the insertion of a short vowel before the new contracted -ῶ, -ᾷς, etc. Thus <foreign>οὐχ ὁράεις</foreign> first became <foreign>οὐχ ὁρᾷς</foreign>, and then <em>metri gratia</em> <foreign>οὐχ ὁράᾳς.</foreign><note n=\"2\">This theory was criticised by Curtius in the Leipziger Studien, iii. pp. 192 ff.</note>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "</item>\n",
      "<item>Paradoxical as this may seem, there can be little doubt that it is substantially right. The forms in question, as Wackernagel justly argues, are not a genuine growth of language. They are the result of literary tradition, that is to say, of the modernizing process which the language of Homer must have undergone in the long period which elapsed before the poems were cared for by scholars. The nature of this process is excellently described and illustrated in his dissertation. In many cases, too, he shows that when the later form of a word ceased to fit the meter, some further change was made by which the metrical defect was cured, or at least disguised. Corruption of this latter kind may often be traced in the various readings of MSS.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But must we suppose that ὁρόω, etc., went through the two changes which Wackernagel postulates?</p>\n",
      "</item>\n",
      "<item>The case is unique, not only from the large number of forms involved, and the singularly thorough and systematic way in which they have been introduced into the text, but also from the circumstance which he has himself so well pointed out, viz. their unreal conventional stamp. They are hardly more \"modern\"—in the sense of being familiar through contemporary speech—than the forms which they have displaced. Wackernagel has shown how ἕως and <foreign>τέως</foreign> supplanted the original ἧος and <foreign>τῆος</foreign>, even where the result was absolute ruin to the verse; as in <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg002:19.367\">Od. 19.367</bibl>, where nearly all the MSS. have ἕως ἵκοιο. Similarly the loss of the old genitive in -οο (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/singular#nine-eight\" target=\"_blank\">98</a></strong>) has produced the forms Aἰόλου, Ἰφίτου, Ἰλίου, etc. scanned - - - . These examples, however, prove too much; for if such unmetrical forms could remain in the text without further change, why do we never find the slightest trace of an unmetrical ὁρῶ?</item>\n",
      "<item>It is a further objection to this part of Wackernagel's theory that in several words the original -αω, -αεις, -αουσα, etc., have been retained. The instances are, <foreign>ναιετάω</foreign>, -άει (Hes. Th. 775), -άουσι, -άων, -άοντα, ὑλάει, -άουσι, ἀοιδιάει, -άουσα, ὁμοστιχάει, <foreign>γοάοιμεν</foreign>, -άοιεν, <foreign>κραδάων</foreign>, ἐλάων, ἱλάονται, <foreign>τηλεθάοντας;</foreign> with ᾱ, ἀναμαιμάει, <foreign>πεινάων</foreign>, -άοντα, <foreign>διψάων.</foreign> (The forms which have lost a ϝ, as <foreign>λάε</foreign>, <foreign>φάε</foreign>, ἔχραον, do not concern us now.) A third variety is exhibited by the form <foreign>ναιετάωσαν</foreign> (-σης,-σῃ, -σας), which occurs in MSS., usually as a variant along with -άουσαν and -όωσαν. These facts are enough to show that the causes which produced the Homeric -οω, -αᾳς, etc., were not of universal efficacy.</item>\n",
      "<item>Is there, then, any way from ὁράω, ὁράεις to ὁρόω, ὁράᾳς except through the contracted ὁρῶ, ὁρᾷς? We have to deal with a time when ὁρῶ, ὁρᾷς were the forms of ordinary speech, while ὁράω, ὁράεις were only known from the recitation of epic poetry. Under such conditions it is surely possible that the poetical forms were partially assimilated to the colloquial forms—that ὁράω, ὁράεις were changed into ὁρόω, ὁράᾳς by the influence of the familiar ὁρῶ, ὁρᾷς. Similarly ἑήνδανε for ἑάνδανε was doubtless due to the presence of the later ἥνδανε, not to any process of contraction and distraction. The principle is constantly exemplified in language; cp. the change of <foreign>φρασί</foreign>, the original dative plural of <foreign>φρήν</foreign>, into <foreign>φρεσί</foreign> through the association of the other case forms.</item>\n",
      "<item>With this modification of Wackernagel's view it is easier to account for the occasional retention of the original -αω, -αεις, etc. If ὁρόω, ὁράᾳς are due to the presence of ὁρῶ, ὁρᾷς in everyday language, we may expect to find a different treatment of words which went out of use in post-Homeric times. Thus <foreign>ναιετάω</foreign> does not pass into <foreign>ναιετόω</foreign> because there was no <foreign>ναιετῶ</foreign> alongside of it in common use. Similarly ἐλόω, ἐλάαν are accounted for by the Attic ἐλῶ, ἐλᾶν; but the Homeric present participle ἐλάων is unaffected. Two instances call for a different explanation, viz. <foreign>πεινάω</foreign> and <foreign>διψάω</foreign>, since they are not rare or poetical words. But these are exceptions which prove the rule. As is shown by the Attic contraction (πεινῇς, etc.), they are not really verbs in -αω. Whatever may be the origin of the ᾱ in the Homeric <foreign>πεινάων</foreign>, <foreign>διψάων</foreign>, etc., they do not belong to the group with which we are now concerned.</item>\n",
      "<item>An example of the process supposed by Wackernagel may be found in the Homeric <foreign>τρωπάω</foreign>, <foreign>τρωχάω</foreign>, <foreign>στρωφάω</foreign>, <foreign>πωτάομαι</foreign> (as to which see Nauck, <em>Mél. gr.-rom.</em> iv. 886). The forms which occur are always contracted, but in every instance except one (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:13.557\">Il. 13.557</bibl> <foreign>στρωφᾶτʼ</foreign>) the uncontracted form can be restored if at the same time the root vowel is shortened. Thus in <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:15.666\">Il. 15.666</bibl> <foreign>μηδὲ τρωπᾶσθε φόβονδε</foreign> we may read <foreign>μηδὲ τροπάεσθε φόβονδε.</foreign> The verb <foreign>πωτάομαι</foreign> only occurs once (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:12.287\">Il. 12.287</bibl> <foreign>λίθοι πωτῶντο θαμειαί</foreign>), while the form <foreign>ποτάομαι</foreign> is well attested. In the other cases the restoration is supported by etymology (τροπάω from <foreign>τροπή</foreign>, etc.), and by the considerable traces of <foreign>τροπάω</foreign>, <foreign>τροχάω</foreign>, <foreign>στροφάω</foreign> in our manuscripts (see Leaf on <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:15.666\">Il. 15.666</bibl>). The process must have been that (e.g.) original <foreign>τροπάεσθε</foreign> became <foreign>τροπᾶσθε</foreign> (which is also found in MSS.), and then <foreign>τρωπᾶσθε.</foreign></item>\n",
      "<item>In the imperfect active assimilation is unknown, mainly because the meter generally allows contraction.

      " that the forms without the augment are comparatively rare in the speeches, the proportion of augmented to unaugmented forms (excluding speeches which mainly consist of narrative matter) being about 10 to 3, whereas in narrative it is about 5 to 7. It would appear therefore that the augment is chiefly omitted where the context shows that past time is meant; and this is confirmed by the remarkable fact that the iteratives, which are only used as historical tenses, do not take the augment. The only clear instance of an iterative form with the augment is ἐ-μισγέσ-κοντο (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg002:20.7\">Od. 20.7</bibl>). On the forms ἔ-φασκο-ν, ἔ-φασκε see § <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/thematic-present-suffix\" target=\"_blank\">49</a></strong>.<note n=\"3\">In an article on the augment in the Journal of Philology (xix. p.211 ff.), Mr. Arthur Platt has shown that, in the case of the aorist, the choice between the augmented and the unaugmented form is largely determined by the sense in which the tense is used. In the common historical or narrative use the augment is often wanting; but in the uses which we may call non-narrative—the use for the immediate past (§ 76), and the gnomic use (§ 78)—the augmented form prevails. With the gnomic use the rule appears to be especially strict. This is obviously a valuable extension and generalization of the facts observed by Koch. In the case of the imperfect there seems to be a preference for unaugmented forms in continuous narrative; but the difference is much less marked. Mr. Platt gives some good reasons for believing that the number of unaugmented forms was originally greater than it is in our text. In this we find a fresh example of the modernizing process to which the poems were subjected from a very early time. </note></p>\n",

      "<p>Much light has been thrown upon the history of the aorist by the comparison of the use in Sanskrit (Delbrück, <em>S. F.</em> ii, and <em>A. S.</em> p. 280). If the result has not been to determine the original force of the aorist, it has at least shown that the question cannot be settled from the material furnished by Greek alone. The use which predominates in Greek, the historical use to assert the happening of a single event in the past, is almost unknown to the earliest Sanskrit. In the Veda the aorist is employed, as often in Homer (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/meanings-present-stem#historical_present\" target=\"_blank\">74</a></strong>), of what has happened in the immediate past. In the early Sanskrit prose (the Brahmanas) the aorist is used of what has happened to the speaker himself. It is worth noticing that these uses, in which the aorist answers approximately to the English perfect with have, are found in later Greek in the case of the verbs whose perfect retains its original meaning. As Mr. Gildersleeve puts it, 'when the perfect is used as a present, the aorist is used as a perfect. So ἐκτησάμην I have gained possession of, <foreign>κέκτημαι</foreign> possessʼ (<em>Am. Journ. of Phil.</em> iv. 429). Hence, if the Greek perfect is originally a kind of present, there is a presumption that the aorist was originally akin in meaning to our perfect. On this view the ordinary historical aorist is a derivative use.</p>\n",

Accordingly, nominal stems are in general either identical with, or formed from, the stems of verbs: Pronouns are found to contain the same elements as those which furnish the personal endings of verbs.

      "<p>It is a question whether they should be written with iota subscript or not. The ancient grammarians prescribed iοtα (Apoll. <em>de Adv.</em> 625.1), and this is confirmed by the forms ᾇ, ὁπᾷ, ἀλλᾷ, <foreign>παντᾷ</foreign> on Doric inscriptions (Ahrens, ii. 369). In Homer however the final vowel of <foreign>πάντῃ</foreign> (or -η) is frequently shortened before another vowel, which is rarely done in the case of final -ῃ (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/hiatus#three-eight-zero\" target=\"_blank\">380</a></strong>)<note n=\"1\">The question between <foreign>πάντῃ</foreign> and&amp;nbsp;πάντη cannot be decided, as Joh. Schmidt supposes (Pluralb. p. 40), by the circumstance that the final vowel is frequently shortened before another vowel in Homer. It is true as was observed by Hoffman (Quaest. Hom. i. p. 58, quoted by Schmidt l. c.) that final&amp;nbsp;η is oftener shortened than final&amp;nbsp;ῃ. In the first four books of the Iliad and Odyssey, as Hartel shows (Hom. Stud. ii. p. 5)&amp;nbsp;-η is shortened 41 times,&amp;nbsp;-ῃ 19 times, and further examination confirms this ratio. But, as Hartel also points out,&amp;nbsp;-η occurs in Homer about three times as often as&amp;nbsp;-ῃ, consequently the shortening of&amp;nbsp;-ῃ is relatively more frequent.</note>\n",
      " It is not unlikely therefore that the original instrumental feminine -η took iοta subscript from the analogy of the dative feminine in -ῃ. There were also Doric adverbs of place in -η or -η (πή <foreign>ποκα</foreign>, ἑκατερῇ, see Ahrens, ii. 362, Brugmann, <em>M. V.</em> ii. 244), in which η is of course pan-Hellenic; but Ionic πῇ, etc., are connected by the meaning with the Doric forms in -ᾳ. Cp. also <foreign>λάθρη</foreign> (-ῃ) with Attic <foreign>λάθρᾱ</foreign> (or -ᾳ). The form <foreign>πάντ-η</foreign> is an extension of the ending -η to the consonantal declension (as with the adverbs in -ωs).</p>\n",

Smyth, <em>The reductiοn of ε</em><em>ι</em><em> to ι in Hοmer</em>, p. 10): but -ῑ can hardly be due to mere itacism, and we have further to explain the forms in -ῐ. The generally accepted view is that -ει is the original locative ending of the ο-declension, which is preserved in the Doric adverbs εἷ, <foreign>πεῖ</foreign>, <foreign>τουτεῖ</foreign>, <foreign>τηνεῖ</foreign>, etc., also in <foreign>οἴκει</foreign> (Menander fr. 456). On this view short ῐ must be the corresponding ending of the consonantal declension, and the analogy of forms of that declension must have been extended so as to create a new adverbial ending -τῐ (cp. ἐγερτῐ́ in Soph.).

This I-stem in the accusative neuter gives the adverbs in -ῐ, in the locative those in -ει or -ῑ.

This explanation was rejected by later scholars (as Brugmann and G. Meyer), and is certainly not quite satisfactory.

      "<p><strong>118*</strong> <i>Suffixes of Different Periods</i>. In the great variety of suffixes discovered by the analysis of the Greek noun it is important to distinguish those which are \"living\" in the periοd of the language with which we are concerned, and those which only survive in words handed from an earlier period. Thus in Homer the oldest and simplest suffixes, as -ο, -ι, -υ, -εσ, -ασ, -εν, -ερ, -ϝο, evidently belong to the latter class. They are no longer capable of being used to form new words, because they are no longer separable in meaning from the stems to which they are attached. On the other hand the nouns in -μο-ς, -μων, -μα, -τηρ, <foreign>τρο-ν</foreign>, -σι-s, <foreign>τυ-ς</foreign>, and the denominatives in -ιο-ς, -ερο-s, -ινο-ς, -τη-ς, etc., are felt as derivatives, and consequently their number can be indefinitely increased by new coinage. Again the use of a suffix may be restricted to some purpose which represents only part of its original usage. Thus -τη ceased, as we have seen, to form abstract nouns, but was largely used to form masculine Nouns of the Agent. So too the suffix -δο, -δη survived in two isolated uses, (1) in adverbs in -δο-ν, -δη-ν and (2) in patronymics. Compare in Latin the older use of -<i>tus</i> in the adjectives <i>cautus</i>, <i>certus</i>, etc., with the living use in <i>amā-tus</i>, etc. Sometimes too a suffix dies out in its original form, but enters into some combination which remains in vigor. Thus -νο survives in the form -ινο, and in -εινο (-εσ-νο).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The distinction of primary and secondary suffixes is evidently one which grew up by degrees, as the several forms came to be limited to different uses.

It will be seen that he gives no countenance to the view (which has been put forward in Germany and elsewhere) that the suffixes were originally without meaning.</note>\n",

      "<p>When the latter part of a compound is derived from a disyllabic verbal stem beginning with a vowel, its initial vowel is often lengthened.<note n=\"10\">This peculiar lengthening in the second member of a compound has been explained by Wackernagel (Dehnungsgesetz, pp. 21 ff.) as the result of a primitive contraction or crasis, with the final vowel of the first part, e. g. ὁμώνυμος for&amp;nbsp;ὁμο-ονυμος. The chief argument for this view is that the lengthening is only found in stems beginning with a vowel—a fact which can hardly be accounted for on any other supposition. Such cases as <foreign>δυσώνυμος</foreign>, in which no contraction can have taken place, may be extensions by analogy of the original type. It is to be understood of course that the resulting long vowel is fixed by the second of the two concurrent vowels: ὁμήγυρις for ὁμο-αγυρις, <foreign>πεμπώβολον</foreign> for <foreign>πεμπε-οβολον</foreign>, etc. Whether this was a primitive phonetic rule, or partly due to the working of analogy, it finds an exact parallel in the temporal augment, which must have been due to the influence of a prefix ἐ- upon the initial vowel of the verb stem. We may compare also the subjunctive forms <foreign>δύνᾱμαι</foreign>, <foreign>τίθηντι</foreign>, etc. (§&amp;nbsp;81). Thus the later contraction, as in <foreign>σκηπτοῦχος</foreign>, Λυκοῦργος, stands in the same relation to the older forms in question as <foreign>εἶχον</foreign>, etc. (with ει for εε) to ἤλασα,&amp;nbsp;ὤμοσα, etc. The primitive Indo-European &amp;quot;sandhi,&amp;quot;—crasis of the final vowel of one word with the initial vowel of the next—was generally given up in Greek, and the system of elision took its place. In compounds we constantly find elision of a short final vowel along with the lengthening (which is then&amp;nbsp;a mere survival): as ἐπ-ήρατος, ἀμφ-ήριστος, <foreign>φθισ-ήνωρ</foreign> (cp. <foreign>φθισί-μβροτος</foreign>). But lengthening does not take place if the vowel is long by position (e. g. ἑτερ-αλκής, Ἀλέξ-ανδρος, ἀναιδής), which seems to indicate that the preservation—though not the origin—of the lengthened stem was a matter of rhythm (as in <foreign>σοφώ-τερος</foreign>). Other exceptions to the rule of lengthening may be variously explained. In some cases, as Wackernagel suggests (p. 51), an initial short vowel may have been retained from the original formation: as in the ancient compounds Βωτιάνειρα (ἀντιάνειρα, <foreign>κυδιάνειρα</foreign>) <foreign>αργιόδοντες</foreign>, <foreign>εὐρύοπα</foreign>, <foreign>εὐρυάγυια</foreign>, where the meter stood in the way of lengthening by analogy. More generally it is a mark of lateness, e. g. in the forms compounded with <foreign>πᾰν</foreign>-, as <foreign>παν-άποτμος</foreign>, <foreign>παν-αφῆλιξ</foreign>, <foreign>παν-αώριος</foreign>, Παν-αχαιοί, and with prepositions, as ἐν-αρίθμιος, ὑπεναντίος (p. 55). Such words as <foreign>αἰναρέτης</foreign> (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:16.31\">Il. 16.31</bibl>), <foreign>λαβρ-αγόρης</foreign> (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:23.479\">Il. 23.479</bibl>), ἀν-όλεθρος (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:13.761\">Il. 13.761</bibl>&amp;nbsp;τοὑς <foreign>δʼ εὗρʼ οὐκέτι πάμπαν ἀπήμονας οὐδʼ ἀνολέθρους</foreign>), ἀνάποινον (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:1.99\">Il. 1.99</bibl>)&amp;nbsp;δυσ-αριστοτόκεια (<bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:18.54\">Il. 18.54</bibl>), have all the appearance of being of the poet&#039;s own coinage. On the view here taken the lengthening in ὠλεσίκαρπος and the similar cases given at the end of the section must be otherwise explained. It is probably of the kind noticed in&amp;nbsp;§ 386.</note>\n",

It must not be supposed, however, that these analogies explain any of the uses in question, or that the cognate accusative is prior to the others, either in simplicity or in the order of development. If we compare the cognate accusative with the use of neuter adjectives and pronouns, we see that (e.g.) ἄριστα <foreign>βουλεύειν</foreign> is simpler, and doubtless earlier in type, than ἀρίστην <foreign>βουλὴν βουλεύειν</foreign>, ἅ <foreign>περ ὑπέστην</foreign> than ὑπόσχεσιν ἥν <foreign>περ ὑπέστην</foreign>, <foreign>τὰ ὑπέστημεν</foreign> than <foreign>τὸν μῦθον ὑπέστημεν.</foreign> Again, <foreign>δαίνυσθαι γάμον</foreign> is probably an earlier phrase than the tautologous <foreign>δαίνυσθαι δαίτην</foreign>, <foreign>τὸν μῦθον ὑποστῆναι</foreign> than ὑπόσχεσιν ὑποστῆναι, etc. The repetition in the noun of the stem already given in the verb is a feature of complexity which itself needs explaining. The cognate accusative, in short, is only a special form of the use of the accusative as a defining οr qualifying word. Grammarians have explained other constructions by its help because it is familiar; but in so doing they have fallen into the error of deriving the simple from the complex.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>146.</strong> The Greek genitive, as appears at once by comparison with Latin or Sanskrit, stands for the original or \"true\" genitive, and also for the ablative. The uses of the genitive may therefore be decided (theoretically at least) between these two cases. The distinction however is more difficult than in the case of the dative; partly, perhaps, because the case forms of the ablative were earlier lost than those of the locative and instrumental, but also from the peculiar syntactical character of the genitive.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The ablative (like the cases already treated) belongs originally to the second group of constructions distinguished in § <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/function-case-endings\" target=\"_blank\">131</a></strong>, i. e. it is construed with the predicate given by a verb. The genitive is originally of the third group; and properly quaifies a noun. Hence the ablative and genitive uses are generally distinguished partly in meaning, partly in grammatical structure. But they are not always distinguished by the structure, since (1) the ablative (like the accusative and dative) may be construed vwith an adjective, and (2) the true genitive may be predicative (like an adjective), and thus apparently construed with a verb. Tο give a single example:<a name=\"one-four-seven\"></a> <foreign>θεῶν γόνος ἐστί</foreign> might be (theoretically) = <em>he is offspring from gods</em> (ablative), and on the other hand <foreign>θεῶν γέγονε</foreign> may be = <em>he is offspring of gods</em> (genitive, see § <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/uses-genitive#one-four-eight\" target=\"_blank\">148</a> </strong>below).</p>\n",

And even if the identification on which he chiefly relies (of the case endng -sya and Suffix -tyα vwith the Pronoun syas, syâ, tyad) should be thought open to question, there can be little doubt that the case is originally &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;adnominal&amp;quot; or adjectival in character.</note>\n",

Grimm the saying that &amp;quot;the Accusative shows the fullest, most decided mastering of an object by the notion contained in the verb of the sentence. Less &amp;quot;objectifying&amp;quot; is contained in the genitive; the active force is tried and brought into play by it, not exhausted.&amp;quot; The contrast, however, is to be traced not merely between the genitive and the accusative, but generally between the genitive and all the cases which are used primarily with verbs. Thus the Genitive of Space and Time may be compared with the locative, the Genitive of Material with the instrumental; and perhaps other genitives vwith the ablative (§ 151.e note,&amp;nbsp;§ 153 note). It is important to observe here (especially since we have adopted the term quasi-partitive for these uses) that the partitive relation is not the only one which may lie at the root of the construction. The genitive expresses any relation, however indefinite, in which one noun may stand to another. 1. The Genitive of Place noticed in § 149.2 is not partitive; for <foreign>δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος</foreign> (e. g.) does not mean within sunset, but on the side of, belonging to, sunset. The genitive is like the Latin novarum rerum esse to be on the side of change; Cp. Liv. 22.50 ad Cannas fugientem consulem viz septuaginta secuti sunt, alterius morientis prope totus exercitus fuit. 2. The Genitive of Time is similar. Such a genitive as ἠοῦς in the morning is to be compared with the use of the adjective in ἑσπέριοι ἀφίκοντο they came in the evening, lit. belonging to the evening, as men of the evening. It differs from the Dative of Time negatively, in the want of a distinct locative meaning. 3. The Genitive of the Person with verbs of hearing, etc. (§ 151.d) is clearly not partitive. The thing heard is not part of, but something belonging to, the person. But the genitive of the sοund heard may be partitive; and so is doubtless the Genitive of Material, § 151.e. As to the Genitive of Price, see § 153. If a true genitive, it is not partitive.</note>\n",

It will be shown, however, that there is ground for believing these forms to have been used for the dative only in the instrumental and locatival senses (the latter being comparatively rare), and for the genitive only in the ablatival sense.

      "<item>Α variety of the same process shows itself in the disuse of tmesis. Besides the prepositions already mentioned, this applies to <foreign>μετά</foreign>, ἀνά, <foreign>κατά</foreign>, <foreign>διά</foreign>, ἐξ, ἀπό, <foreign>εἰς.</foreign><br />\n",

It is virtually lost (except as a poetical survival) with ἀμφί, <foreign>περί</foreign>, <foreign>μετά</foreign>, ἀνά, and <foreign>σύν.</foreign></item>\n",

      "    <title>Explanation of Verbal Nouns</title>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>230.</strong> The preceding chapters deal with the simple sentence, that is to say, the sentence which consists of a single verb, and the subordinate or qualifying wοrds (case forms, adverbs, prepositions) construed with it (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/function-case-endings\" target=\"_blank\">131</a></strong>). We have now to consider hοw this type is enlarged by means of the verbal nouns.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The infinitive and participle, as has been explained (§ <strong><a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/verbal-nouns\" target=\"_blank\">84</a></strong>), are in fact nouns. The infinitive is an abstract noun denoting the action of the verb, the participle a concrete noun expressing that action as an attribute. They are termed \"verbal\" because they suggest or imply a predication, such as a finite verb expresses (<i>e. g.</i> ἔρχεται ἄγων <foreign>αὐτούς</foreign> implies the assertion ἄγει <foreign>αὐτούς</foreign>), and because the words which depend upon or qualify them are construed with them as with verbs (ἄγων <foreign>αὐτούς</foreign>, not ἄγων <foreign>αὐτῶν</foreign> <i>bringer of them</i>). Thus they have the character of subordinate verbs, governed by the finite verb of the sentence, and serving at the same time as centers of dependent clauses.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The distinction between infinitives and other abstract substantives, and again between participles and other primitive adjectives, was probably not always so clearly drawn as it is in Greek. The infinitives of the oldest Sanskrit hardly form a distinct group of words; they are abstract nouns of various formation, used in several different cases, and wοuld hardly have been classed apart from other case forms if they had not been recognized as the precursors of the later more developed infinitive. The participles, too, are variously formed in Sanskrit, and moreover they are not the only nouns with which the construction is adverbial instead of being adnominal.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The peculiarity of the verbal nouns in point of meaning may be said to consist in the temporary and accidental character of the actions or attributes which they express. Thus πpάττειv and <foreign>πρᾶξαι</foreign> suggest a particular doing, momentary or progressive, at or during a time fixed by the context; whereas <foreign>πρᾶξις</foreign> means <i>doing</i>, irrespective of time; <foreign>πράκτωρ</foreign> <i>one whο does</i>, generally or permanently, a <i>dοer</i>; and so in other cases. The distinction is especially important for Homer. In the later language there are uses of the infinitive and participle in which they lose the verbal element, and have the character of ordinary nouns; <i>e. g.</i> <foreign>τὸ πράττειν</foreign> is nearly equivalent to <foreign>πράξις</foreign>, <foreign>οἱ πράττοντες</foreign> to <foreign>πράκτορες</foreign>, etc.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>231.</strong> The Greek infinitive is a case form—usually the dative—of an abstract verbal noun (<i>nomen actiοnis</i>). As a dative it expresses an action to which that of the governing verb is directed, or for which it takes place—viz. a purpose, effect, bearing, etc.—of the main action. Thus <foreign>δόμεν-αι</foreign> <i>to give</i>, being the dative of a stem <foreign>δο-μεν</foreign> <i>giving</i>, means \"<i>to</i> or <i>fοr</i> giving\" hence <i>in order to give</i>, <i>sο as to giνe</i>, etc. But owing to the loss of all other uses of the dative in Greek (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/uses-dative#one-four-three\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>143</strong></a>), and the consequent isοlatiοn of the infinitive, its meaning has been somewhat extended. For the same reason, the infinitives derived from other cases (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/verbal-nouns#eight-five\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>85</strong></a>) are no longer used with different meanings but are retained merely as alternative forms.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The dative meaning evidently accounts for the common constructions of the infinitive with verbs expressing <i>wish</i>, <i>cοmmand</i>, <i>power</i>, <i>expectatiοn</i>, <i>beginning</i>, and the like.</p>\n",

In the Veda these infinitives, or case forms on the way to become infinitives (<i>werdende Infinitiνe</i>, Delbr.), are mostly datives, expressing end or purpose, and several of them are identical in formation with Greek infinitives.</p>\n",

Consequently, these forms stand quite apart from the case system, and have ceased to be felt as real case forms. Thus the Greek infinitive is a surνiνal, both in form and in construction, from a period when the dative of purpose or consequence was one of the ordinary idioms of the language. In Latin, again, this dative is common enough, and often answers in meaning to the Greek infinitive; compare (e.g.) ὥρη ἐστὶν <foreign>εὕδειν</foreign> with <i>munitioni tempus relinquere</i> (Roby, 1156), ἀμύνειν <foreign>εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι</foreign> with <i>auxilio esse</i>, etc. The retention of the construction in Latin is connected, on the one hand with the fact that the Latin dative is a \"true\" dative, on the other hand with the comparatively small use that is made in Latin of the infinitive of purpose. Similarly in classical Sanskrit the Dative of Purpose etc., is extremely common, but the dative infinitives have gone entirely out of use (Whitney, § 287 and § 986)—a result of the \"struggle for existence\" which precisely reverses the state of things in Greek.</p>\n",

A deictic pronoun—it will be convenient to adopt the Greek words—is one that marks an object by its position in respect to the speaker: <i>I</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>this</i> (here), <i>yonder</i>, etc. An anaphoric pronoun is one that denotes an object already mentioned or otherwise known—the term thus including many demonstratives (<i>that</i> same man, <i>the </i>man, etc.), as well as the relative.

      "<p><strong>264.</strong> <em>Homeric and Attic Article.</em> After the account given in the preceding chapters of the Homeric uses of the article it is hardly necessary to show in detail where they differ from the corresponding uses in Attic Greek. What we have chiefly to observe is that the difference is often greater in reality than it appears to be at first sight. Familiar as we are with the defining article of modern languages, and of Attic Greek, we naturally import it into Homer whenever it is not made impossible by the context. But even when a Homeric use falls under the general head of the \"defining article\" (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/ὁ-ἡ-τό#two-six-one\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>261</strong></a>), the effect is perceptibly different from that of the definite article properly so called. In Homer the article indicates, not that a person or thing is a known or definite one, but that it is presented to us in an antithesis or contrast. Objects so contrasted are usually definite, in the sense that they are already known or suggested by the context hence the readiness with which the later defining sense can be applied to passages in Homer. Thus <foreign>αὐτὰρ ὅ γʼ ἥρως</foreign> can usually be translated <i>but the herο</i> (<i>before mentioned</i>), as though ὁ distinguished him from other heroes. But when we find that <foreign>αὐτὰρ ὁ</foreign> in Homer constantly means <i>but he</i>, or <i>but the other</i>, and that it may be followed by an epexegetic noun</p>\n",

In Attic <foreign>τὰ κακά</foreign> or <foreign>τὸ κακόν</foreign> implies that evils form a class of things, distinguished from all other things.

      "<p>It is a further question, and one that cannot be fully discussed here, whether any uses of the article found in our text of the Iliad and Odyssey are post-Homeric, and evidence of a later origin of the books or passages where they occur.

Accordingly we find ὅ = <i>because</i> chiefly with verbs of feeling, which regularly take a neuter pronoun of the ground of feeling.<note n=\"1\">The clauses of this type are the subject of Dr. Peter Schmitt&#039;s monograph, Ueber den Ursprung des Substantivsatzes mit Relativpartikeln im Griechischen (Würzburg, 1889). He rightly takes ὅ (ὅτι, etc.) to be an accusative of the &amp;quot;inner object&amp;quot; (§ 133), but he seems to have overlooked the real difficulty; which is that ὅ supplies an object to the verb of the principal clause, not to the verb of its own clause. Thus he says &amp;quot;ὁρῷ ὃ&amp;nbsp;νοσεῖς war ursprünglich: ich weiss, was du krankst; <foreign>οἶδ’ ὅ σε ἑπῄνεσε</foreign> ich weiss, was er dich gelobt hat&amp;quot; (p. 21). But the two meanings, I know in what respect you are sick and I know that you are sick are quite distinct, and are given by essentially different constructions of the relative. Let us take as example a clause which follows a verb of feeling: ἐχώσατο ὅτι <foreign>οἱ βέλος ἔκφυγε χειρός.</foreign> The construction with ἐχώσατο is the accusative of the inner object (as <foreign>τόδε χάεο</foreign>, <foreign>τό γε δείδιθι</foreign>, etc.). But ὅτι is in a different clause from ἐχώσατο: the full construction would be ἐχώσατο (τὸ) ὅτι. Schmitt would say that ὅ <foreign>τι ἔκφυγε</foreign> also is an accusative of the inner object—that the sentence meant originally was angered in respect of this in respect of which it flew out. It is surely more probable that ἐχώσατο ὅ τι was like ἐξ οὗ from the time that, <foreign>εἰς ὅ</foreign> to the time that, <foreign>οὕνεκα</foreign> for the reason that, etc. (§ 267.5), so that ὅ τι was an accusative by attraction, and had no real construction with its own verb.</note>\n",

He rightly takes ὅ (ὅτι, etc.) to be an accusative of the \"inner object\" (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/uses-accusative#one-three-three\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>133</strong></a>), but he seems to have overlooked the real difficulty; which is that ὅ supplies an object to the verb of the principal clause, not to the verb of its own clause. Thus he says \"ὁρῷ ὃ <foreign>νοσεῖς</foreign> war ursprünglich: ich weiss, was du krankst; <foreign>οἶδ’ ὅ σε ἑπῄνεσε</foreign> ich weiss, was er dich gelobt hat\" (p. 21). But the two meanings, <i>I know in what respect you are sick</i> and <i>I know that you are sick</i> are quite distinct, and are given by essentially different constructions of the relative. Let us take as example a clause which follows a verb of feeling: ἐχώσατο ὅτι <foreign>οἱ βέλος ἔκφυγε χειρός.</foreign> The construction with ἐχώσατο is the accusative of the inner object (as <foreign>τόδε χάεο</foreign>, <foreign>τό γε δείδιθι</foreign>, etc.). But ὅτι is in a different clause from ἐχώσατο: the full construction would be ἐχώσατο (τὸ) ὅτι. Schmitt would say that ὅ <foreign>τι ἔκφυγε</foreign> also is an accusative of the inner object—that the sentence meant originally <i>was angered in respect of this in respect of which it flew out</i>. It is surely more probable that ἐχώσατο ὅ τι was like ἐξ οὗ <i>from the time that</i>, <foreign>εἰς ὅ</foreign> <i>to the time that</i>, <foreign>οὕνεκα</foreign> <i>for the reason that</i>, etc. (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/correlative-clauses#two-six-seven-point-five\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>267.5</strong></a>), so that ὅ τι was an accusative by attraction, and had no real construction with its own verb.</item>\n",

      "<p><strong>316.</strong> Passing over for the present the question whether the quasi-imperative or the quasi-future use is to be regarded in each case as representing the original meaning of the mood, we proceed to consider the uses in subordinate clauses. Here the main distinction is that between \"final\" and \"conditional\" ;if these terms are used with some latitude: especially if we rank with the final clauses not only those which distinctly express the end or purpose of an action, but also all clauses which are referred to the time of the governing verb. It is true that this distinction does not always apply: <i>e. g.</i> to the subjunctive in</p>\n",

For the present purpose, accordingly, there are two kinds of clause to be considered, (1) final and object clauses, and (2) conditional clauses.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Regarding the meaning of the subjunctive and optative in final clauses there can be little doubt. The subjunctive in most instances follows either a 1st Person (present or future), or an imperative; that is to say, it expresses the immediate purpose with which the speaker announces his own action, or commands the action of others. Hence, by a natural transference, it comes to express the purpose of another person (viz. the subject of the principal clause). Similarly the optative, whether as the mοοd of wish or of expectation, comes to express a wish or expectation not now felt, but spoken of. Again, by virtue of its character as a softened or less confident future, it naturally expresses a purpose that does not lie within the speakerʼs own sphere of action or direct influence.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>In conditional clauses, on the other hand, the condition or supposition is not subordinated to the time of the governing verb, but is made from the present point of view of the speaker. The question arises: What is the original force of the subjunctive and optative in this use?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the case of the subjunctive we naturally look to the quasi-imperative use. It is common to use the imperative as a way of stating a supposition, as when we say \"let it be so,\" meaning \"if it is sο\" (cp. Latin <i>cras petitο, dabitur</i>). This view is confirmed by the fact that negative conditional clauses take μὴ, not <foreign>οὐ;</foreign> that is to say, they are felt to be akin to prohibition rather than denial. Thus ὃς <foreign>μὴ ἔλθῃ</foreign> literally means not \"who will not come\" (ὃς <foreign>οὐκ ἂν ἔλθῃ</foreign>), but \"who shall not come,\" i. e. whom we are not to suppose coming.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Similarly we may understand the optative in these clauses as the mood of concession—\"admitting this to be so\"—and so in a negative sentence, ὃς <foreign>μὴ ἔλθοι \"</foreign>whom I agree to suppose not coming.\" For the choice of the mood does not depend on the greater or less probability of the supposition being true, but on the tone in which it is made—on the degree of <i>vividness</i>, as Mr. Goodwin says, with which it is expressed (Moods and tenses, § 455).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It may be objected that on this view we ought to have <foreign>εἰ οὐ</foreign>, not <foreign>εἰ μή</foreign>, whenever the verb is in the indicative. But there is no difficulty in supposing that μή was extended to the indicative on the analogγ of the clauses with the subjunctive and optative; just as <foreign>μὴ ὤφελον</foreign> is an extension from the common use of μὴ in wishes. And this is strongly supported by the circumstance that in fact <foreign>εἰ οὐ</foreign> with the indicative occurs several times in Homer.</p>\n",

On the other hand, in the very few examples of <foreign>εἰ οὐ</foreign> with a subjunctive, the οὐ goes closely with the verb, viz. <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:3.289\">Il. 3.289</bibl> (οὐκ ἐθέλωσιν), 20.139 (οὐκ <foreign>εἰῶσι</foreign>). On the whole, therefore, it is probable that the subjunctive in conditional clauses represents the tone of requirement in which the speaker asks us to suppose the condition to be true, and that the optative. implies concession, or willingness to make the supposition involved.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>317.</strong> <i>Original meaning.</i> Whether the use of the subjunctive as an emphatic future was derived from its use to express will, or vice versa, and whether the optative originally expressed wish or supposition, are questions which take us back to a very early period in the history of Indo-European speech. The two moods are found in the same uses (generally speaking) in Homer and in the Veda; the formation of these uses therefore belongs in the main to the period before the separation of the different languages—to the period, indeed, when the original parent language was itself in course of formation. The problem therefore is one on which comparison of the earliest forms of the known Indo-European languages can hardly throw any light. It is as though we were asked to divine whether the use of <i>shall</i> in commands (thou shalt not kill) or in predictions (you shall see me) is the older, without recourse to earlier English, or to other Germanic languages. Some considerations of a general character may however be suggested.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><i><strong>a.</strong></i> The subjunctive is strongly differentiated from the imperative by its personal endings, and especially by the existence of a 1st person.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><i><strong>b. </strong></i>In most languages it will be found that the imperative meaning is expressed in more than one way. Thus in Sanskrit we find the imperative proper, the injunctive, the subjunctive, and the optative; in Greek the imperative, the subjunctive and certain uses of the future. The reason of this is evident. Variety in the expression of will and wish is one of the first needs of human society. The form which has been appropriated to express command is unsuitable to courteous request, still more unsuitable to humble entreaty. Accordingly other forms are used, precisely because they are not imperatives. In time these acquire a quasi-imperative character, and fresh forms are resorted to as the same want of a non-imperative mode of expression is again perceived.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><i><strong>c.</strong></i> The use of the secondary endings in the optative points to the conclusion that in its origin it was a mood of past time. The tendency to use a past tense in wishes, and in some kinds of supposition, may be amply illustrated from English and other modern languages.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><i><strong>d.</strong></i> The uses with οὐ go far to show that the quasi-future sense of the subjunctive and optative is at least as primitive as the quasi-imperative sense. If the strong negation <foreign>οὐ γένηται</foreign> is derived by gradual change of meaning from a prohibition, the appearance of οὐ is difficult to explain.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><i><strong><a name=\"three-one-eight\"></a>e.</strong></i> The use of the Subj as an imperative may be compared to the Attic use of the future in a \"jussive\" sense, and in final clauses to express purpose (Goodwin, p. 373). The change from an expression of will to one of expectation is one to which it wοuld be much more difficult to find a parallel.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>318.</strong> <em>Conditional Protasis with ε</em>ἰ. The derivations that have been proposed for the particle εἰ or αἴ are too uncertain to furnish ground for any theory as to the manner in which the conditional protasis may have been formed. The question arises for us on the passages in which εἰ with the optative is used to express a wish, Thus in <foreign>εἴ τι καλέσειε</foreign> <em>I pray sοme one to call</em> we may take the clause as conditional, with a suppressed apodosis (καλῶς ἂν ἔχοι or the like). Or we may follow L. Lange in holding that the Clause is not subordinate at all, the particle εἰ being originally a kind of affirmative interjection, used to introduce expressions of wish and supposition.

      " but Lange himself does not do so. He regards the εἰ clause of supposition (<i>Fallsetzung</i>) as developed independently of the εἰ clause of wish.

The main difference between Homer and later writers in regard to the moods may be said to be that the later uses are much more restricted.

It is also worth observing here that in Homer, as has been said (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/uses-subordinate-clauses\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>316</strong></a>), the final clause in the great majority of instances expresses the speakerʼs own purpose, not a purpose which he attributes to a person spoken of; see §§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/subjunctive-subordinate-sentences\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>280</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/subjunctive-subordinate-sentences#two-eight-one\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>281</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/relatival-adverbs#two-eight-five\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>285</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/relatival-adverbs#two-eight-six\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>286</strong></a>.

The further license by which a past purpose is thought of as if still present—sο that the subjunctive is used instead of the optative—is not Homeric (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/subjunctive-after-secondary-tenses\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>298</strong></a>).</p>\n",

Thus <foreign>θέλγει ὡς λάθηται</foreign> literally means \"charms so that he shall forget,\" <foreign>θέλγει ὅπως λήσεται \"</foreign>charms so that he will forget.\" The same conclusion seems to follow from the rule that ὅπως and ὄφρα may be used with a future, but not ὡς οr ἵvα (Goodwin, § 324). For ὡς <i>in the manner that</i> fits a direct purpose better than ὅπωs <i>in some such manner that</i>, or ὄφpα <i>till the time that</i>.

      "<p>Regarding the origin of this curious idiom a very probable conjecture has been made by Delbürck (<i>Synt. Forsch</i>. iv. p. 120). In the Veda it has been shown by Grassmann that the prohibitive particle <i>mâ</i> is never found with the forms of the imperative proper, but only with the so-called \"spurious conjunctive\" or \"injunctive.\" Hence it may be inferred that the imperative was only used originally in positive commands, not in prohibitions. Again, it appears that in Sanskrit the imperative is nearly confined to the present tense, and in Greek the forms of the 1st aorist imperative (κλέψον, middle <foreign>κλέψαι</foreign>) are certainly of late origin. The fine distinction which is made, in the imperative as well as in other moods, between the continuous action expressed by the present stem and the momentary action expressed by the aorist belongs to the specific development of Greek. Accordingly Delbrück suggests that the extension of the imperative to express prohibition took place at a time when the aorist imperative had not come into general use; hence it was only carried into the present tense. In other words, the form <foreign>μή κλέπτε</foreign> came into use in pre-historic Greek as an extension of the positive <foreign>κλέπτε</foreign>, and superseded <foreign>μὴ κλέπτῃς</foreign>, but <foreign>μὴ κλέψῃ</foreign>s kept its ground, because the form <foreign>κλέψο</foreign>v did not then exist. This account of the idiom seems much more probable than any attempt to explain it on psychological grounds.</p>\n",

Consequently, the substitution of <foreign>μέν</foreign> for <foreign>μάν</foreign> in the Iliad may have taken place very early.

Again, the diphthongs ῃ, ηυ, etc., are longer than the single vowels η, ω, etc., and also longer than the diphthongs ει, ευ, οι, <foreign>ου.</foreign> In short, the poetical \"quantities\" must not be supposed to answer exactly to the natural or inherent length of the syllables.

There are comparatively few instances in which the two consonants do not come at the beginning of a word of the form ˘ ˉ , so that the last syllable of the preceding word must be a short one. On the other hand, the extent to which neglect of position is allowed for metrical convenience is limited, and depends on the natural quantity of the consonants in question, <i>i. e.</i> the actual time occupied by their pronunciation. Sonant mutes (<i>mediae</i>) are longer than surd mutes (<i>tenues</i>); gutturals are longer than dentals or labials; and of the two liquids λ is longer than ρ. Thus shortening is tolerably frequent before πρ and τρ, less so before κρ, πλ, κλ, θρ, <foreign>χρ.</foreign> With other combinations of mute and liquid, as φρ, βρ, δρ, and with σκ and ζ, it seems to be only admitted for the sake of words which the poet was absolutely compelled to bring in, such as Ἀφροδίτη, Σκάμανδρος, Ζάκυνθος, <foreign>βροτός</foreign>, with its compounds, etc. No exceptions are found before γρ, γλ, φλ, κν, κμ, or any combination other than those mentioned.

      " The most probable account of the matter is that most of the roots or stems affected originally began with two consonants, one of which was lost by phonetic decay. Thus initial ρ may stand for ϝρ (as in ϝρήγ-νυμι), or σρ (as *σρέω, Sanskrit <i>sravāmi</i>); <foreign>λίς</foreign> is probably for <foreign>λϝίς</foreign> (with a weaker stem than the form seen in <foreign>λέϝ-ων</foreign>); <foreign>νυός</foreign> is for <foreign>σνύος</foreign> (Sanskrit <i>snushā</i>); <foreign>νιφ-άς</foreign> goes back to a root <i>sneibh</i> (Gothic <i>snaivs</i>, <i>snow</i>); <foreign>μοῖρα</foreign> is probably from a root <i>smer</i>; <foreign>σέλμα</foreign> is for <foreign>σϝέλμα</foreign> (Curt. <i>s. ν.</i>); and <foreign>δει</foreign>- in <foreign>δει-νός</foreign>, etc., is for <foreign>δϝει</foreign>- (cp. <foreign>δεί-δοικα</foreign> for <foreign>δέ-δϝοικα</foreign>). It is not indeed necessary to maintain that in these cases the lost consonant was pronounced at the time when the Homeric poems were composed. We have only to suppose that the particular combination in question had established itself in the usage of the language before the two consonants were reduced by phonetic decay to one. Thus we may either suppose (<i>e. g.</i>) that <foreign>κατὰ ῥόον</foreign> in the time of Homer was still pronounced <foreign>κατὰ σρόον</foreign>, or that certain combinations—κατα-σρέω, ἐΰ-σροος, <foreign>κατὰ σρόον</foreign>, etc.—passed into <foreign>κατα-ρρέω</foreign>, ἐΰ-ρροος, <foreign>κατὰ ῤῥόον</foreign> (or <foreign>κατᾱ ῥόον</foreign>). There are several instances in which a second form of a word appears in combinations of a fixed type. Thus we have the form <foreign>πτόλις</foreign>, in <foreign>ποτὶ πτόλιος</foreign>, Ἀχιλλῆα <foreign>πτολίπορθον</foreign>, etc.; <foreign>πτόλεμος</foreign>, in <foreign>μέγα πτολέμοιο μεμηλώς</foreign>, ἀνὰ <foreign>πτολέμοιο γεφύρας.</foreign> Similarly a primitive <foreign>γδοῦπος</foreign> survives in ἐρί-γδουπος (also ἐρί- <foreign>δουπος</foreign>), ἐ-γδούπησε, and <foreign>γνόος</foreign> in ἀγνοέω. Cp. also the pairs <foreign>σμικρός</foreign> and <foreign>μικρός</foreign>, <foreign>σκίδναμαι</foreign> and <foreign>κίδναμαι</foreign>, <foreign>σῦς</foreign> and ὗς, <foreign>ξύν</foreign> and <foreign>σύν.</foreign> It is at least conceivable that in the same way the poet of the Iliad said <foreign>μοῖραν</foreign> and also <foreign>κατὰ σμοῖραν</foreign>, <foreign>μειδιάων</foreign> but <foreign>φιλο-σμειδής</foreign>, <foreign>δὴν ἦν</foreign> at the beginning of a line, but <foreign>μάλα δϝήν</foreign> at the end, and so in other cases.</p>\n",

      "<p>It is true that the proportion of the words now in question which can be proved to have originally had an initial double consonant is not very great. Of the liquids, the method is most successful with initial ρ, which can nearly always be traced back to <i>νr</i> or <i>sr</i>. And among the words with initial ν a fair proportion can be shown to have begun originally with σν (νευρή, <foreign>νυός</foreign>, <foreign>νιφάς</foreign>, <foreign>νέω</foreign>, <foreign>νύμφη</foreign>). The difficulty is partly met by the further supposition that the habit of lengthening before initial liquids was extended by analogy, from the stems in which it was originally due to a double consonant to others in which it had no such etymological ground. This supposition is certainly well founded in the case of ρ, before which lengthening became the rule.</p>\n",

The Vedic lengthening appears to be one of a group of similar changes of quantity which affect a short final vowel, and which are in their origin rhythmical, since they generally serve to prevent a succession of short syllables (Wackernagel <i>Das Dehnungsgesetz der griechischen Composita</i>, p. 12 ff., quoted by Brugmann <i>l. c.</i>). The same thing may evidently be said of the Homeric -ῑ in many of the cases quoted, as <foreign>πατέρι</foreign>, <foreign>σάκεϊ</foreign>, ἔτεϊ. Hence it is probable that the lengthening dates from the Indo-European language, and is not due in the first instance to the requirements of the hexameter. But in such a case as Oδυσσῆϊ it may be that the Greek poet treats it as a license, which he takes advantage of in order to avoid the impossible quantities ˘ ˉ ˉ ˘ (cp. ὀϊζῡρώτερος for the unmetrical ὀϊζῡρότερος).</p>\n",

The explanation, therefore, must be sought either in the force of the <i>ictus</i>, or in the pause (which necessarily adds something to the time of a preceding syllable), or in the combination of these two causes.

In the case of ᾱο this supposition is borne out by the fact that -εω is often found before a vowel, as Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος (read Πηληϊάδαʼ), and by the rarity of the contraction of εο to ευ (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/contraction-homer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>378*</strong></a>), There is less to be said for elision of -ο in the ending -οιο.

      "\n",
      "<p><strong>379.</strong> Hiatus is a term which is used by writers on meter in more than one sense. It will be convenient here to apply it to every case in which a word ending with a vowel or diphthong is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, and the two vowel sounds are not merged together (as by elision, crasis, etc.) so as to form one syllable for the meter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It would be more scientific, perhaps, to understand the word hiatus as implying that the two vowels are separated by a break or stoppage of vocal sound, so that the second begins with either the rough or the smooth \"breathing.\" Thus it would be opposed to every form of diphthong (including synizesis), the characteristic of which is that the two vowels are slurred together, by shifting the position of the organs without any perceptible interruption of the current of breath. This definition, however, might exclude the case of a long vowel or diphthong shortened before an initial vowel (as <foreign>τὴν δʼ ἐγὼ οὐ</foreign>, where the final ω seems to be partly merged in the following ου). Again when a final ι or υ comes before a vowel without suffering elision, it is probable that the corresponding semi-vοwel (= our <i>y</i> or <i>w</i>) is developed from the vowel sound, and prevents complete hiatus.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>380.</strong> <em>Long vowels before hiatus</em>. The general rule is that a long final vowel or diphthong coming before a vowel forms a short syllable in the meter. This shortening is very common in Homer: cp. <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:1.299\">Il. 1.299</bibl> <foreign>οὔτε σοὶ οὔτε τῳ ἄλλῳ</foreign>, ἐπεὶ <foreign>κτλ.</foreign>, where it occurs in three successive feet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But the natural quantity may be retained before hiatus when the vowel is in the arsis of the foot, as Ἀτρεΐδῃ, Ἀγαμέμνονι, ὅς <foreign>κʼ εἴποι ὅτι κτλ.</foreign> And in a few instances a long vowel or diphthong is allowed to remain long in thesis.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:1.39\">Il. 1.39</bibl> Σμινθεῦ· <foreign>εἴ ποτέ τοι κτλ.</foreign></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The readiness with which long syllables are allowed before hiatus varies with the several long vowels and diphthongs; partly also it depends on the pause of the sense.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The long diphthongs (as they may be called), viz. ῃ and ῳ, are the most capable of resisting the shortening influence of hiatus; next to them are ευ and ου, and the long vowels η and ω, while ει, οι, and αι are at the other end ob the scale. Α measure of this may be gained by observing how often each of these terminations is long before a vowel, and comparing the number with the total number of times that the same termination occurs. Thus it appears that out of every 100 instances οf final ῳ, it is long before hiatus about 23 times. Similarly final -ῃ is long 19 times, -ευ 6·7 times, -ου 6 times, -η 5·7 times, -ω 4 times, -ει 1·8 times, -οι 1·6 times, and -αι only 1·3 times. Thus hiatus after ῳ and ῃ is scarcely avoided, while after ει, οι and αι it is very rare.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In a large proportion of the instances in which a long vowel retains its quantity before hiatus it will be found that the hiatus coincides with a division either in the sense or the rhythm. Of the examples in the arsis of the foot, more than half occur before the penthemimeral caesura, where there is almost always a pause, while in thesis the same thing is chiefly found to occur either after the first foot, as <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:2.209\">Il. 2.209</bibl> ἠχῇ, ὡς ὅτε <foreign>κτλ.</foreign>; <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg002:11.188\">Od. 11.188</bibl> ἀγρῷ, <foreign>οὐδὲ κτλ.</foreign>; or after the fourth foot (in the Bucolic diaeresis).</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>381.</strong> <em>Shortening of Diphthongs Before Hiatus</em>. Regarding the nature of the process by which a diphthong before hiatus was reduced to the time or metrical value of a short syllable two probable views have been maintained.</p>\n",
      "<list rend=\"numbered\">\n",
      "<item>Curtius holds that whenever long syllables are shortened by the effect of hiatus something of the nature of elision takes place. Thus η and ω lose the second half of the vowel sound, while αι, eι, οι lose the ι. In support of this he points to the facts of crasis. Thus <foreign>καὶ ἐγώ</foreign> in becoming <foreign>κἀγώ</foreign> may be supposed to pass through the stage <foreign>κα ἐγώ.</foreign></item>\n",
      "<item><p>According to an older view, which has been revived and defended with great ingenuity by Hartel<note n=\"1\">Homerische Studien, iii. pp. 7 ff.</note>\n",
      " the ι or υ in a diphthong is turned into the corresponding spirant; so that <foreign>καὶ ἐγώ</foreign> becomes <foreign>κα-ι̯-εγώ</foreign>, and ἐκ Πύλου ἐλθόν becomes ἐκ Πύλο-ϝ-ελθόν.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It is certainly in favor of this latter supposition that it does not oblige us to suppose the frequent elision of the two vowels which in general are the least liable to be elided. The explanation however is not a complete one. It does not account for the shortening of ῃ and ῳ, which on the principle assumed by Hartel would become <foreign>ηι̯</foreign>, <foreign>ωι̯.</foreign> On the whole it seems most probable that the shortening in question was effected, for diphthongs as well as for simple long vowels, by a process in which ancient grammarians would have recognized rather \"synizesis\"—viz. the slurring of vowels together without complete loss of any sound—than either elision or contraction. And this conclusion is supported by the general tendencies of the Ionic dialect, which was especially tolerant of hiatus, and allowed numerous combinations of vowels, such as εα, εο, εω, <foreign>εοι</foreign>, to have the value either of one <a name=\"three-eight-two\"></a>syllable or two.<note n=\"2\">The use of εο for <foreign>ευ&</foreign>amp;nbsp;in Ionic inscriptions shows, not indeed that ευ and εο were identical in pronunciation, or that εο was a true diphthong, but certainly that εο was very like ευ, and might be monosyllabic in scansion.

      "\n",
      "<p><strong>388.</strong> In seeking to arrive at general conclusions as to the rules and structure of the Homeric hexameter, it was necessary to leave out of sight all the words whose metrical form is uncertain on account of the possible or probable loss of an initial consonant. It is time to return to this disturbing element of the enquiry.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The scholars who first wrote on this subject had few materials for their investigations outside of the Homeric poems. To them, therefore, the digamma was little more than a symbol—the unknown cause of a series of metrical anomalies. In the present state of etymological knowledge the order of the enquiry has been to a great extent reversed. It is known in most cases which of the original sounds of the Indo-European languages have been lost in Greek, and where in each word the loss has taken place. Hence we now come to Homer with this knοwledge already in our possession. Instead of asking what sounds are wanting, we have only to ask whether certain sounds, of whose former existence we have no doubt, <a id=\"three-eight-nine\" name=\"three-eight-nine\"></a>were still living at the time when the poems were composed, and how far they can be traced in their effect on the versification.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>389.</strong> <em>Nature of the Evidence from Meter</em>. The questions which are suggested by the discovery in Homer of traces of a lost digamma cannot be answered without some reference to the very exceptional circumstances of the text.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Whatever may be the date at which writing was first used in Greece for literary purposes, there can be no doubt that the Homeric poems were chiefly known for some centuries through the medium of oral recitation, and that it was not until the time of the Alexandrian grammarians that adequate materials were brought together for the study and correction of the text. Accordingly when these scholars began to collect and compare the manuscripts of Homer, they found themselves engaged in a problem of great complexity. The various readings, to judge from the brief notices of them preserved in the scholia, were very numerous; and they are often of a kind which must be attributed to failure of memory, or the license of oral recitation, rather than to errors of transcription. And the amount of interpolation must have been considerable, if there was any ground for the suspicions so often expressed by the ancient critics.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It follows from these circumstances that an attempt to restore the lost ϝ throughout the text of Homer cannot be expected to succeed. Such an attempt necessarily proceeds on the assumption that the text which we have is sound as far as it goes, or that it is so nearly right that we can recover the original by conjecture. With an imperfect text the process can only be approximate. We may be satisfied if the proportion of failure is not greater than the history of the text would lead us to expect.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The loss of the ϝ-sound, moreover, must have been itself a cause of textual corruption. It led to irregularities of meter, especially to frequent hiatus, and there would be a constant tendency to cure these defects by some slight change. The insertion of the <foreign>ν ἐφελκυστικόν</foreign> was almost a matter of course (see however § 391). The numerous alternative forms used in the poetical language, and the abundance of short particles such as γε, τε, ῥα, etc., made it easy to disguise the loss of ϝ in many places. We cannot be surprised, therefore, if we have often to make the reverse changes.</p>\n",

Thus an original ϝείκοσι is supported by the forms ϝίκατι and ϝείκατι on Doric and Boeotian inscriptions, by the Laconian <foreign>βείκατι</foreign> (given by Hesychius), and again by Latin <i>viginti</i>, Sanskrit <i>νiṁçati</i>, etc.; an original ϝέσπερος by the form ϝεσπαρίων on a Locrian inscription, as well as by Latin <i>νesper</i>; original ϝιδεῖν, ϝοῖδα, etc., by ϝίστορες on inscriptions, <foreign>γοῖδα</foreign> and <foreign>γοίδημι</foreign> in Hesychius (erroneously so written, as Ahrens showed, for ϝοῖδα and ϝοίδημι), and also by Latin <i>νideο</i>, Sanskrit <i>νedmi</i>, <i>νeda</i>, English <i>wit</i>, etc. We do not, however, propose to discuss the external evidence, as it may be called, by which the loss of an initial ϝ is proved, but only to consider the degree and manner in which the former existence of such a letter can be shown to have affected the versification of Homer. For this purpose it will be enough to give a list of the chief words in question, and in a few cases a statement, by way of specimen, of some of the attempts made to restore the ϝ to the text.<note n=\"1\">The first systematic attempt to restore the digamma was made by Heyne in his edition of the Iliad (1802). It was based upon Bentleyʼs manuscript annotations, of which Heyne had the use. The first text with restored ϝ was published by Payne Κnight (1820). Much was done by the thorough and methodical Quaestiones Homericae of C. A. J. Hoffmann (Clausthal, 1842-48). The ϝ was again printed in the text of Bekkerʼs second edition (Bonn, 1858). The light of the comparative method was brought to bear upon it by Leskien (Rationem quam I. Bekker in restituendo digammο secutus est examinavit Dr. A. Leskien, Lipsiae, 1866). The most complete treatise on the subject is that of Κnös (Upsaliae, 1872). The most important contributions, in addition to those mentioned, have been made by Leo Meyer (K. Z. xviii. 49), and by W. Hartel (Hom. Stud. iii). Most of the cοnjectures given in this chapter come from one or other of these sources.</note>\n",

Much was done by the thorough and methodical <em>Quaestiones Homericae</em> of C. A. J. Hoffmann (Clausthal, 1842-48). The ϝ was again printed in the text of Bekkerʼs second edition (Bonn, 1858). The light of the comparative method was brought to bear upon it by Leskien (<em>Rationem quam I. Bekker in restituendo digammο secutus est examinavit Dr. A. Leskien</em>, Lipsiae, 1866). The most complete treatise on the subject is that of Κnös (Upsaliae, 1872). The most important contributions, in addition to those mentioned, have been made by Leo Meyer (<i>K.

It seems probable, therefore, that in the forms οὗ, ὅν, etc., the ϝ was no longer pronounced, though traces of the former pronunciation remained (as in the case of <foreign>οὐλαμός</foreign> and ὄψ).

      "\n",
      "<p>The scholars who first became aware of the traces of a lost letter in Homer assumed that in the original form of the poems this letter, or at least the consonantal sound for which it afterwards stood, was consistently used—that it was in fact one of the ordinary sounds of the language—and accordingly they directed their efforts to restoring it to the text. This was the principle on which Bentley made his famous series of emendations: and which was carried out by Bekker in his edition of 1858. Of late years, however, different views of the matter have been taken. Leskien seems to have been the first to maintain that the passages which do not admit ϝ are not necessarily corrupt or spurious, but are to be regarded as evidence of an original fluctuation in the use of the sound. His view is adopted and defended by Curtius (<i>Grandz</i>. p. 550, 5th ed.). Prοf. Hartel has more recently put forward a theory which agrees with that of Curtius in treating the apparent neglect of the ϝ as part of the original condition of the text. But he ascribes this neglect, not to irregularity in the use of the sound, but to the intermediate half-vοwel character of the sound itself.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>400.</strong> If we are not satisfied that the ϝ had the value of an ordinary consonant at the time when the Homeric poems were produced (or when they received their present form), we may explain the influence which it has on the meter in several ways.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><em>Hypothesis of alternative forms</em>. We may suppose that each word that originally had initial ϝ was known to Homeric times in two forms, an older form with the ϝ—confined perhaps to the archaic or poetical style—and a later in which ϝ was no longer heard. Just as the poet could say either <foreign>σῦς</foreign> or ὗς, either <foreign>πόλις</foreign> or <foreign>πτόλις</foreign>, either <foreign>τελέσσαι</foreign> or <foreign>τελέσαι</foreign>, so he may have had the choice between ϝἄναξ and ἄναξ, ῾ϝηδύς and ἡδύς, etc.</p>\n",

The word ἄστυ, for example, is found very frequently in the combinations <foreign>προτὶ ἄστυ</foreign>, ἀνὰ ἄστυ, <foreign>κατὰ ἄστυ</foreign>, etc.; but these do not prove the pronunciation ϝάστυ for Homeric times any more than (<i>e. g.</i>) ἐπιεικής proves an Attic ἐπιϝεικής. Such phrases, it may be said, were handed on ready-made, with a fixed metrical value, and served as models for fresh combinations, in which the hiatus was retained as part of the familiar rhythm.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This explanation is inadequate, for the following reasons</p>\n",
      "<list rend=\"numbered\">\n",
      "<item>The instances of ϝ are not confined to the commonest words, or to frequently recurring phrases. Thus it is found in ἴον <i>a νiοlet</i>, ἴτυς <i>the felly of a wheel</i>, ἰτέη <i>a willow</i>, ἄρνες <i>lambs</i>. And it is used (generally speaking) in all the different forms of each verb or noun, whether of common occurrence or not (ἰδεῖν as well as ἰδέειν, ἴνεσι as well as ἴς and ἶφι, etc.).</item>\n",
      "<item>The other cases in which tradition can be shown to have had the effect of retaining older phrases and combinations are not really parallel. In the Homeric Hymns the ϝ can be clearly traced, but the proportion of instances which do not admit ϝ is markedly different. Taking the words already used as examples, viz. ἄναξ, ἄστυ, ἔργον, <foreign>οἶκος</foreign>, ἰδεῖν, we find them in the Hymns 152 times, while the ϝ is neglected in 36 places, or nearly one-fourth of the whole. Again if we look at the words which begin with ο, as <foreign>οὐλαμός</foreign>, ὄψ, etc. (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/loss-ϝ-homer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>393</strong></a>), we find similar conditions. The traces of ϝ are undoubted, but do not predominate as with ἄναξ or ἄστυ. Other examples may be seen in the traces of the double consonants, σρ, σλ, σν, ϝρ discussed in § <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/lengthening-ρ-λ-μ-ν-σ-δ\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>371</strong></a>. Compare the free use of alternate forms, as ἔρεξα and ἔρρεξα, <foreign>προ-ρέω</foreign> and ἐπιρρέω, with the almost invariable recognition of δϝ in <foreign>δέος</foreign>, <foreign>δείσας</foreign>, etc. We seem to be able to draw a broad distinction between the predominating influence of the ϝ in Homer and the arbitrary or occasional influence of the older forms in other cases. And these other cases, we may conclude, give us a measure of the force of tradition in such matters, while in the case of the Homeric ϝ the effect is due to its retention as a living sound.</item>\n",
      "<item>A further argument in favor of ϝ as a real sound in Homer has been derived from the places in which ῾ϝε, ῾ϝοι suffer elision (§ <a href=\"http://dcc.dickinson.edu/grammar/monro/words-initial-σϝ\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>391</strong></a>) ; see Leafʼs note on <bibl n=\"tlg0012.tlg001:24.154\">Il. 24.154</bibl>.

      "<p><strong>402.</strong> Another supposition, akin to the last discussed, is that in the words which originally had initial ϝ the ordinary effects of an initial consonant remained after the sound itself was no longer heard. Such a phenomenon would be by no means without parallel in language. In French, for instance, elision is not allowed before certain words beginning with <i>h</i>, as <i>le héros</i>, <i>la hauteur</i>, though the <i>h</i> is no longer pronounced. Similarly, then, it may be held that the facts of Homeric meter only prove the habit or rule of treating certain words as if they began with ϝ.</p>\n",

      "<p>On the other side it may be urged that the <i>h</i> of <i>héros</i>, <i>hauteur</i>, etc., is only traced in one way—by hiatus, and that only in a small number of combinations; whereas the ϝ not only protects hiatus, but also makes position. Moreover the retention of a traditional usage of this kind is very much easier in an age of education. Anomalies which would naturally disappear in a few years are kept alive by being taught to successive generations of children. It seems difficult to believe that the ϝ would have kept its present place in the memory of the poets unless it were familiar, either to the ear as a present sound, or to the eye as a letter in the written text.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>403.</strong> The theory recently advanced by Prof. Hartel is one to which it is difficult to do justice in a short statement. The careful re-examination which he has made of the metrical facts has convinced him that the influence of the ϝ is not occasional or arbitrary, but in the strictest sense universal in Homer. He does not however regard the passages in which the ϝ appears to be neglected as corrupt or spurious, but explains them on the theory that the ϝ in Homer has not the full value of an ordinary consonant: comparing it, for instance, not with the initial V of Latin, but with the sound which that letter has in the combination QV.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Hartel's chief argument is that hiatus after short vοwels is the most common of the metrical facts pointing to a lost ϝ, and especially that it is much commoner than lengthening by position, the numbers being 2995 and 359 respectively. But the force of this argument depends in the case of each word on the metrical form; thus before a wοrd of iambic form the syllable must be short, hence we may find hiatus, but not lengthening: before an anapaest the reverse holds gοοd. If (using Hartel's list) we take the instances in which ϝ is followed in the verse by two short syllables—the words being ἄγεν, ἅλις, ἔαρος, ἕλικες (with ἑλίκωπες, etc.), ἔπος, ἐρόω, ἔτος, ἰαχή, ἴδον—we shall find that they number 415, and the ϝ makes position in 98. But this is not materially different from the proportion which will be found to obtain in the case of any common word of the same metrical form (such as <foreign>πόλεμος</foreign>).</p>\n",

The forms preserved on these inscriptions do not indeed prove anything directly as to the Homeric digamma. We cannot infer from them, for instance, that the symbol ϝ was ever used in any written copies of the poems, or that the sound which it represented in other dialects was known to the Homeric language.

The scanty Phocian inscriptions yield the important forms ϝέξ, <foreign>αἰϝεί</foreign>, <foreign>κλέϝος</foreign>, with no early examples of omission; and the little known Pamphylian dialect is equally constant, so far as it has been made out.

C. On the other hand, since there is no example on the inscriptions of Euboea itself, the sound does not seem to have survived there down to the date of the earliest examples of writing, viz. the 6th century B.

      "<p>It has been recently pointed out by P. Κretschmer (<i>K. Z.</i> xxxi. 285) that the Ionic change of ᾱ to η cannot be placed very early. The name Μῆδοι underwent the change—the original ᾱ appears in the form Mᾶδοι on the monument of Idalion—and the Medes must therefore have become known to the Ionians before it was completed. The Persian names which reached Ionia later—Δᾱρεῖος, Μιθριδάτης, etc.—retain their ᾱ. Similarly the old Carian Mίλατος became the Ionic Μίλητος. Hence the Ionic η is later than the contact of Ionians with the nations of Asia Minor. Nοw the anomalous η after ρ in the Attic <foreign>κόρη</foreign> and <foreign>δέρη</foreign> is to be explained from the older forms <foreign>κόρϝη</foreign>, <foreign>δέρϝη</foreign> (cp. <foreign>κόρρη</foreign> from <foreign>κόρση</foreign>). Consequently the loss οf ϝ in Attic must be later than the change of ᾱ to η, and <i>a fοrtiοri</i> later than the Ionian migration. This inference is confirmed by the ο of the comparatives <foreign>κενότερος</foreign> and <foreign>στενότερος</foreign>, pointing as it does to the forms <foreign>κενϝός</foreign>, <foreign>στενϝός</foreign> (since the lengthening of the ε, as in Ionic <foreign>κεινός</foreign>, <foreign>στεινός</foreign>, never took place in Attic).</p>\n",
