AND OF ALL THINGS TRUE AND

<pb/>PREFACE

This book, now offered to the public, is the fruit of seven years
of experimentation and of much counsel with those interested in
the plan which it embodies.

It has already gone through four mimeographed editions, and
has been used for several years: in Ohio Wesleyan University,
in Oberlin College, and in Southwestern Presbyterian University.
In all these cases it has had marked success in creating and sustaining
interest in beginning Greek, where the crux of the whole
problem of the future of Hellenic studies lies.

The reasons which have conyinced the author of the necessity
for basing the work of beginners on Homeric instead of on Attic
Greek will be found in a paper, entitled “A Year—or more —
of Greek,” published in the Classical Journal for February, 1918,
and in a second paper, “Homer and the Study of Greek,” which
is printed in this book, following the table of contents. To all
who may be interested in the subject, from the standpoint of
humanistic studies, the author would heartily commend the reading
of Andrew Lang’s delightful little essay, “Homer and the Study
of Greek,” published in his collection of Essays in Little.

It is hardly to be hoped that a book of this kind, which seeks to
establish a new path to our common goal, will be so free from minor
errors as would one along the old established lines. Hence the
author will be profoundly grateful to those who will be generous
enough to make suggestions looking toward the betterment of the
work as well as to those who will be kind enough to point out any
errors. Naturally, in a work of this nature, there is the constantly
recurring problem of how to reconcile most successfully effective
pedagogy and scientific accuracy of statement.

The book does not pretend to be a text where the advanced
Homeric scholar will find catalogued every stray Homeric form, or

v
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

supposedly Homeric form, but its first object is to teach beginners
to read Greek intelligently and with pleasure.

It is not intended that the ordinary student shall master all the
grammar found in this text: much of it is for reference only. But
certainly every teacher should have at least this much Homeric
grammar thoroughly at command and be overflowing with it, not,
however, to the extent of attempting to teach all of it. The prime
object of first year work, as so admirably stated by Prof. Gildersleeve, 
is “a maximum of forms, a minimum of syntax, and early
acquaintance with Greek in the mass.” To gain this object, it
is necessary to read, read, read Greek.

In the paradigms and vocabularies, both simple and compound
forms of verbs are used to supplement each other, and a free use
of analogy is employed, as is commonly done in books of this
kind. In the verbal forms, the augment is regularly supplied when
missing.	t

Those opposed to the employment of prose sentences in Homeric
language will find it easy to omit these; but the author is convinced
that a better grasp of Homeric forms can be secured by
their use.

After this book is completed successfully, any one of several
roads is open for a continuation of the Greek course:

(1)	Probably the most satisfactory method is to continue for
some time with Homer, reading copious extracts from the Iliad
and Odyssey. The student is now well prepared to handle successfully
the standard school editions of these.

(2)	The passage from Homer to the Attic Drama is an easy one,
and is the most satisfactory introduction to the Attic dialect.
This is the course which the author would strongly recommend, as
most likely to be of the greatest value and as having probably the
strongest appeal to the most students. Euripides furnishes the
easiest reading, and several of his plays have been published in
convenient form with vocabularies (Longmans, Green &amp; Co.),
and with both vocabularies and notes (Macmillan &amp; Co.). This
could be followed by any one of several possibilities, some more
drama, Plato, or the New Testament.

vi
<pb/>PREFACE

(3)	Some Herodotus could now be read with not much difficulty,
and his work would admirably supplement the Homeric stories.

(4)	It is quite possible to read some Plato now, using a good
edition of one of the dialogues, with vocabulary and notes, such as
that of Seymour and Dyer.

(5)	Many will find a strong appeal in the Lyric Poets, which
are very easy after a fair amount of Homer and contain some of the
choicest gems in all Greek literature.

(6)	Some may want to read Hesiod, who is the easiest of all
authors after Homer. His' importance has not always been
recognized, and he has been entirely too much neglected in our
colleges.

(7)	The New Testament could be studied to good advantage
after Homer, and is recommended to those intending to enter the
ministry.

(8)	Those who are wedded to Xenophon, who teach him with
success, and who feel that he must come early in the course, will
find Homer a much better preparation for Xenophon than Xenophon
is for Homer. There are a number of good school editions,
and students can now read rapidly considerable quantities of the
Anabasis, or of any of the other works of Xenophon.

Other things being equal, the teacher should of course select
the author in which he has the greatest interest and for which he
has the most enthusiasm. He will find the work not only much
easier, but more successful as well.

To all who have assisted, directly or indirectly, in the production
of the present book, the author would here express his sincerest
appreciation and gratitude. Lack of space prevents giving a
complete list of names, but the author feels that special mention
is due to Prof. Francis G. Allinson of Brown University, for generously
reading the whole of the manuscript and for making many
helpful suggestions; to Prof. Samuel E. Bassett of the University
of Vermont, and to Prof. Edward Fitch of Hamilton College, who
also went over the manuscript and made many valuable criticisms ;
to Prof. Walter Petersen of Bethany College, whose help on a number
of grammatical problems has been invaluable; to Miss Mabel

vii
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

Drennan of the Swanton, Ohio, High School, for making the whole
of the two general vocabularies; to Prof. Shirley Smith of Oberlin
College and Mr. Joseph Adameç, graduate student at Yale, for
checking up the vocabulary; to Mr. W. J. Millard, student at
Southwestern Presbyterian University, for verifying the Biblical
quotations; to Prof. Wilmot Haines Thompson of Acadia University,
for reading the manuscript, making a number of valuable suggestions,
and for much valuable assistance in reading proof; to Prof.
Leigh Alexander of Oberlin College, who has generously placed
at the disposal of the author the results of two years of experience
with the book in his classes, who has read all the proof and has
saved the book from a number of errors; to the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, for the loan of some unusually fine photographs for
illustrations; to D. C. Heath &amp; Co., for the use of illustrations from
Webster’s Ancient History, one of their texts; to Prof. Frank E.
Robbins of the University of Michigan, and to the Classical
Journal, for permission to use Prof. Robbins’s valuable statistics
on Greek verb forms, which appeared in the Classical Journal,
15, 2; to Dr. Alice Braunlich of the Davenport High School, to
Prof. G. B. Waldrop of the Westminster School, and to Dr. D. W.
Abercrombie, recently of Worcester Academy, for help in reading
the proof; and to the J. S. Cushing Company (The Norwood
Press) for their very careful and painstaking typographical work.

If this book will contribute to the value and interest of the study
of beginning Greek, the author will feel that his seven years of
work upon it have not been spent in vain. The time has come
when lovers of the humanities everywhere must join hands in
the promotion of the common cause. If anything seems to be of
mutual advantage, we must first test it carefully and then hold
fast to it if we find it good. Then, to all teachers of Greek and
every true friend of humanistic studies and of culture in its best
sense, the author would say in conclusion:

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

In an article entitled “A Year—or more— of Greek,” contributed
to the February, 1918, number of the Classical Journal,
the author sets forth a few of the more important reasons why
the present system of teaching beginners in Greek should be
revised to meet modern conditions. The sum and substance of
the article was a plea for the abandonment of Xenophon for beginning
work, something which should have been done years ago,
and the substitution of Homer in his place. The paper embodied
the results of several years of experimentation; and the primary
reason urged for the change was based on the comparative literary
value of the two authors and their appeal to beginning students.
As we view the situation to-day, we are compelled to confess that
in the hands of the average teacher, when applied to the average
student, Xenophon and all his works are all too often found to be
tedious and dreary. This leaves out of count the exceptional
teacher, who has large and enthusiastic classes in the Anabasis
year after year, for such teachers could make any subject fascinating.
Homer on the other hand possesses those qualities which
make him especially interesting, as well as of permanent value, to
the majority of students who still take Greek.

In this connection the author may be permitted to quote from
the article just mentioned:1 “The reasons which make Homer
so desirable are apparent when once the question is seriously
considered. His work is homogeneous in vocabulary, in literary
style and idioms employed, and in metrical form; so that when
students once get a fair start in him, further progress becomes
easier and more accelerated. He employs all three persons, with
all modes and tenses of the verb, so that all forms that are learned

1 C. J. 13, 5.

XXIX
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

are used enough to be kept fresh in the students’ mind and do not
have to be learned again when they begin anything which is in
dialogue form. His vocabulary is fairly limited, enough so in
fact that it does not present any special difficulty to the beginner.
His sentences are short, simple, and clear-cut, having none of the
involved structure which makes so much of Xenophon really too
difficult for first-year work. The verse, which has been considered
a bar, is an actual help, as it is quite easily learned and is a marked
aid in memorizing considerable portions of Greek, which is important
at this stage. Furthermore, the rules of quantity are a
considerable help in simplifying and illustrating the principles of
accent. As he uses only one type of verse, and that the simplest
— the dactylic hexameter — the ordinary student usually becomes
quite adept at reading this before the end of the first year’s work.

“The prose composition for the first year’s work may be based
upon Homer, the students using Homeric forms and constructions,
without knowing of the existence of any other kind. This may be
done without the slightest fear of blunting their sense of discrimination
between poetic and prose diction and style, a sense
which cannot possibly be developed until they have had several
years’ work and have read a considerable amount of Greek in both
prose and poetry. Homer is so straightforward and simple in
what he has to say, with nothing obscure, mystical, or far-fetched
in any way, that he is quite intelligible to the average high-school
freshman; and at the same time he possesses the qualities of high
literary art in such a marked degree that he appeals strongly to
the oldest and most advanced members of any college class.

"Furthermore, Homer is the best possible preparation for all
later Greek literature, much of which is unintelligible without
a fair knowledge of him. He was to Greek literature what the
Bible has been to English, and a great deal more as well. He leads
us somewhere, not merely into a blind alley as does Xenophon,
both with reference to later Greek literature and to much of the
best in later European literature as well, where his influence has
been incalculable and perhaps greater than that of any other
single writer. In him are the germs of so many things. We have

xiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

the narrative highly developed, the beginning of the drama,
oratory, statecraft, seamanship, war, adventure, and religion —
in fact, life as it was to the old Greeks in its manifold aspects.

“ Then the student who has taken only a very little of beginning
Greek, even if he has progressed no farther than the end of the
first book of the Iliad, has come into vital contact with the magic
and the music of the Greek language, used in one of the most
beautiful, one of the most varied, and one of the most influential
literary compositions of all ages; and though he may have devoted
considerable labor to mining the gold, he cannot, truthfully say,
and probably will not want to say, that Greek for him has been a
waste of time.”

To begin the study of Greek with Homer, it would be necessary
to substitute Homeric for Attic Greek for the work of the first year:
the student would be taught Homeric forms and constructions as a
basis for future work, and would devote to the study of Homer
the time which is now occupied by Xenophon. It is the purpose
of the present paper to develop more in detail some of the most
important reasons which make such a change not only desirable
but imperative if Greek is to be saved as a vital factor in our educational
system.

The idea of such a plan first suggested itself to the writer several
years ago, when, full of boundless enthusiasm Ύογ his subject
and for all things Greek, he was attempting to teach first-year
work and Xenophon, and was compelled to admit to himself that
his efforts were not meeting noth what might be called success.
Too many good students refused to take Greek in the first place,
and of those who did enlist, too many, even of the better ones, were
discouraged by the unending round of grammatical forms, leading
up to an author whose works are not of a nature to fire the imagination
and stir the hearts in the breasts of our youth, as can be,
and is, done by the great masterpieces of Hellas such as the Iliad
and the Odyssey.

The writer would like to make it plain that he is not a hater of
Xenophon, but that he greatly enjoyed his first year of Greek,
taken in the old way, as well as his Xenophon, later. The same

xv
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

is probably true of most classical scholars. This goes a long way
toward explaining why they are now teaching Greek and Latin
instead of sociology or mechanical engineering. It would be distinctly
misleading however for those who have a special taste
for linguistic work and who enjoyed reading the production of
such authors as Caesar and Xenophon to infer therefrom that
their case is at all typical of the mass of students who take these
subjects. Although the description in Andrew Lang’s essay,
“Homer and the Study of Greek,” is probably too highly colored,
the account that he gives of his own experience and that of his
fellows in the study of beginning Greek and Xenophon ought to
have a lesson and a warning for every one who is still a friend of
the classics. He makes it quite plain that they found Xenophon
anything but inspiring, and that most of them thoroughly hated
him, an experience of many good students, which is too common
to be ignored.

It is only fair to state that although this idea of beginning Greek
with the reading of Homer is original with the writer, it is not
new. This was the regular method employed by the old Romans
in teaching their boys Greek, and it was highly commended by
that capable and judicious old schoolmaster, Quintilian, as the
best possible plan. Since that time it has been used now and then
by some of the world’s ablest educators and scholars. It was thus
that Joseph Scaliger (de la Scala), one of the most brilliant
names in the whole history of classical scholarship, taught himself
Greek at Paris; and many more of the great scholars of the past
learned their Greek through Homer. It was tried also by Herbart,
who began a series of experiments in Switzerland, in 1797, where he
employed this method with marked success in private tutoring.
Later he continued his experiments on a larger scale in the teachers’
training college at Koenigsberg, with such good results that he
was thoroughly convinced that this was the only suitable method
of teaching beginning Greek. At his suggestion it was tried by
Dissen, by Ferdinand Ranke, and by Hummel, all of whom were
hearty in its praise; and, most important of all, by Ahrens, at
Hanover, where it was used for thirty years (1850-1881), with

great success, but was finally abandoned because of the lack of
suitable text books and because of the opposition of other Gymnasia
which refused to adopt such a revolutionary plan. It has also
been recommended occasionally, but without success, by other
scholars and humanists, notably by Goethe, by Andrew Lang,
and by Wilamowitz, in Europe; while in America it has been
advocated in one form or another by Seymour, Bolling, Shorey,
Lane Cooper, and others. But hitherto no systematic series of
text books has been issued which are so well adapted to carry the
students through Homer and introduce them to Attic Greek as the
ones which have been worked out in connection with Xenophon.
It has become highly important that this lack be supplied, if possible,
in order that this plan, which has been tried by several
with such good success, may be tested on a wider scale, so that we
may see whether or no it will succeed in the hands of the average
teacher of beginning Greek. Thus students should be prepared
to strike immediately into the heart of Greek literature, instead
of having to go a long way around, as at present.

As to the superiority of Homer over Xenophon, from the standpoint
of literary values, and of interest for the average student,
there can be no quarrel. It remains for us to investigate the
relative advantages and demerits of each as mediums for teaching
the language.

In the first place it is essential that we disabuse our minds of the
once prevalent notion, long since exploded, but still more or less
consciously held by many, that the Attic dialect is the norm by
which all other Greek is to be judged. The language of Homer is
earlier and naturally differs from it in many essentials; therefore
it was long maintained that Homeric Greek is irregular, crude and
unfinished. Hellenistic Greek, which represents a later development
of the language, has its differences; therefore Hellenistic
Greek must be degenerate. Such an idea is utterly unscientific
and ignores completely the modern historical point of view of the
development and growth of languages. Any period which has
given birth to literary productions of surpassing merit and artistic
excellence is justified by its own works; it contains its own lin-

xvii
<pb/>HOMEEIC GKEEK

guistic standards, and will richly repay those who take the trouble
to study it. To call Homeric Greek anomalous and irregular,
because it differs in some particulars from the Attic dialect, is as
misleading as it would be to say that the language of Shakespeare
is immature and eccentric because he does not write the same type
of English as does George Ade or Stephen Leacock. As a matter
of fact, the language of the Homeric poems is quite as finished, has
quite as many virtues, and is quite as much of a norm for its
period and style of composition as Xenophon is for his; and the
different forms in Homer are no more aberrations on his part than
those of Xenophon are marks of degeneracy for him. And Attic
Greek, after all, is but one of a number of dialects, coming at neither
end but in the middle of the development of the Greek language.
It is rarely found pure in any of the great authors, and in none
which are suitable for beginners.

According to our present system, students are taught a smattering
of Attic Greek. Then they are given a smattering of Homer,
who represents a period several centuries earlier. Then again
comes some more Attic Greek, and if the student continues in his
work he usually gets some Doric, with sometimes a little Lesbian,
and the Ionic of Herodotus, to which is commonly added a dash
of the Koine for further confusing variety. All of this comes at
such times and at such points in his development that it is practically
impossible for the ordinary student to obtain a clear conception
of what the Greek language is like and what are the fundamental
processes of its development. As a result grammar becomes
a nightmare to be dreaded instead of an opportunity to study the
structure of one of the most interesting and instructive languages
in existence. This has reference to the linguistic features, apart
from its literary value. If on the other hand we begin with Homer
and obtain a good grounding in his language, the transition from
that to later Greek is simple and natural and in accordance with
well-established laws, so that a student who once gets a grasp
of the processes involved not only has acquired a valuable scientific
point of view, but he might be untrue enough to the traditions of
countless students of the past to find Greek grammar interesting.

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

Furthermore, since most of us learned our Attic Greek first,
when we came to Homeric Greek and found so many different
forms, the feeling very naturally arose with many that Homer has
many more forms than Attic Greek, and that they are more difficult.
On the contrary, the Homeric forms are not only simpler and more
transparent than the Attic and as a consequence more easily
learned — many Attic forms have to be explained hy a reference
to the Homeric ones — but the Homeric forms are considerably
fewer in number. This is best seen by a reference to the declensional
endings, as exemplified in the two tables, 479, 649.

From these tables we see that there are, all told, 86 Homeric
forms of the noun and adjective to be learned as against 108 Attic
forms. But this is not all. Many forms in both Attic and
Homeric Greek are so rare that it would be manifestly absurd to
compel first-year students to memorize them. For our purposes,
then, we must omit the unusually rare forms from both tables.
In the first table (479) we shall omit a number of forms which
many would include, and count only those not inclosed in brackets
which are regularly included as essential by the standard beginners’
books based on the Attic dialect. We shall not count the very
rare Homeric forms, but shall be liberal enough to include a few
which are too rare to be learned in reading Homer but are important
for students intending to read Attic Greek later. We
find then that students who' begin with Homeric Greek need to
learn only 55 forms as against 80 (88 according to some) of
the Attic. This means that it is necessary to memorize about
fifty per cent more forms in order to be able to read the first
four books of the Anabasis than it would be to read the first
six books of the Iliad. Furthermore, in the pronouns, by not
compelling the student to memorize any form which does not
occur on an average of at least once every two or three thousand
verses, there would be fewer Homeric forms to be learned here
also. The same is true of the verbs. The reflexive pronoun, for
example, and the future passive and future optative of verbs are
not found in Homer; the middle voice regularly retains the uncontracted
forms of the endingS and not in a part only as in Attic

xix
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

Greek; and in many other ways the forms are simpler and more
easily learned. In fact many books for beginners find it easier to
teach Attic Greek by a constant reference to the earlier forms,
which in many cases are the Homeric.

The occasional irregular forms, which are omitted from the
ones to be learned, should be grouped in some convenient way for
reference, but need not be memorized, as they are regularly given
in their alphabetical place in the vocabulary of any good school
edition and in the ordinary lexicons. Thus the student need
not be required to memorize the five forms of the present infinitive
of ειμί, or the five forms of the genitive of iyu>, e.g., but could
learn one of each and not burden his memory with forms which
are found in every vocabulary.

Many Atticists have maintained that the great number of
irregularities in Homeric Greek would be an added difficulty to the
beginner. It is true that they are troublesome, but not so troublesome
as the considerably greater number of irregularities in Attic
Greek. Any one who will take the trouble to count them will
find that the irregular formations in Attic Greek considerably
outnumber those in Homer. There is not space here to catalogue
the various irregularities, heteroclites, metaplastic forms, etc., of
Attic Greek, but the lists given in Kuehner-Blass, or any other of
the more elaborate Greek grammars, are enough to convince the
most skeptical.

If we leave aside the irregularities and look at a few regular
formations which must be memorized, the evidence is none the less
conclusive. For example, the “regular” declensions of such words
as πόλις, βασιλεύς, νανς, τέηχνς, αστν, comparatives in -ιων, and other
forms which will readily occur to any one who has studied Attic
Greek, are so complicated that they are not ordinarily mastered by
students of beginning Greek, and it would be rather remarkable
if they were. Or let us consider a single class, such as typical
words of the third declension in νς, as πηχνς, δίπηχνς, ηόνς, ίγχελνς,
Ιχθύς. If the student learned the declension of any one of these,
and attempted to decline the rest accordingly, he would go far
astray; for of these five words, all of the third declension, and all

xx
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

ending in vs in the nominative, no two are declined alike
throughout. A comparison of the declensions of lyxcXvs (eel) with
that of Ιχθνs (fish) will illustrate the point. It seems that the old
Athenians were never able to decide definitely whether an eel
was a fish or a serpent. Accordingly, we find that they declined
lyXcXvt the first half of the way like Ιχθνs, while the other
half was different. What a pity that there are not a few more
such convenient mnemonic devices to help the student keep his
bearings on his way through the maze of Greek morphology!
If a student finally learned to decline such a word as raCs, he would
not know how to begin the declension of another word formed in
the same way, such as ypavi; nor would a student who had
learned the declension of βονς in Attic Greek know the declension
of the next word like it, χονς, and he might be led
very far astray by such a simple and common word as voCs.
All of these forms, and many more which could be cited, are highly
interesting to philologists, as they illustrate so beautifully certain
abstruse principles in Greek phonology and morphology. Unfortunately
they do not usually have the same strong appeal to
the beginner who is trying very hard to learn how to read
Greek.

The whole system of contraction, which is regular at times, and
the variations caused by it in the general rules- of accent and
quantity, all of which are so confusing and so difficult to the
ordinary beginner, are so little used in Homer that they can very
profitably be omitted, or else touched quite lightly, and the time
saved can be invested elsewhere to much greater advantage.

In the field of syntax Homer is so much simpler than Xenophon
that students ordinarily find him a great deal easier. Tlius
Homer lacks the articular infinitive; long and involved passages
in indirect discourse never occur, as well as many other strange
and foreign characteristics of Attic Greek and Xenophon, all of
which give a great deal of trouble to the ordinary beginner.

These elements all contribute to a quicker and an easier learning
of Greek through Homer, as has been abundantly proved by experiments
also. Thus students who begin with Homer regularly read

xxi
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

more Greek in the time devoted to him than do those who begin
with Xenophon and spend this time on the Anabasis.

It has long been a commonly accepted myth that Homer has
such an enormous vocabulary that students would have more
than ordinary trouble with it. In fact the vocabulary of the first
six books of the Iliad is no larger than that required for reading the
Anabasis, and one can read the whole of the Homeric poems, including
the hymns, without having to learn many more words
than to read Xenophon, and without having to learn so many
words as are necessary for the reading of Plato.

There are, it is true, a great number of words in Homer which are
used only once (απαξ λεγάμενα).1 The Iliad has 1097 of these,
while the Odyssey has 868, making a total of 1965. However,
this is not nearly so large as the number used by Xenophon, who
has 3021 απαξ λεγάμενα,2 of which 433 are in the Anabasis, as compared
with 266 (238 if we omit the Catalogue of Ships) in the first
six books of the Iliad.

It is highly important too in gaining a vocabulary to learn words
which will be used in other authors read later in the course, and to
acquire so far as possible the more fundamental meanings of words
from which their later uses are derived. Ahrens, who made a
careful study of this problem, gives the palm to Homer here without
question. According to' him, the words in Homer are much
nearer their fundamental meanings, and take on different shades of
significance in the various later authors. If one wishes to obtain
a clear grasp of Greek onomatology and semasiology, he should
begin with Homer by all means and would thus be prepared to
see more readily the later turns in the meanings of words and
phrases, which in many cases vary considerably in authors of the
same period, and sometimes even in the same author. Thus there
are over 400 words in the Anabasis which either do not occur
at all in Xenophon’s other works, or else with a different signification.
Rutherford (The New Phryn., 160 if.) says: “It did not

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

escape the notice of later Greeks that Xenophon’s diction was very
different from that of pure Attic writers, and there are still extant
several remarks upon this point. ... A busy man, living almost
wholly abroad, devoted to country pursuits and the life of the
camp, attached to the Lacedaemonian system of government, and
detesting the Athenian, Xenophon must have lost much of the
refined Atticism with which he was conversant in his youth. It is
not only in the forms of words that he differs from Attic writers,
but he also uses many terms — the ονόματα γλωσσηματικά of
Galen — altogether unknown to Attic prose, and often assigns to
Attic words a meaning not actually attached to them in the
leading dialect.”

When it comes to the actual number of words of Xenophon and
Homer which enter into the vocabulary of other Greek writers,
the following tables will show their relation to some of the most
important authors read in college.

The vocabularies of Xenophon and Homer, which are compared
in these lists, are: Xenophon’s Anabasis entire, and Homer’s
Iliad, books I-VL The pages as given above are according to
the Teubner texts. The number of words in Xenophon’s Anabasis
is approximately the same as that of Homer’s Iliad, books I-VI.

In these lists, words which are closely enough related to others
that ordinary students who know the meaning of one may infer
the other are counted but once, as θάνατο·;, αθάνατοί; βαίνω, Ζκ-
βαίνω, καταβαίνω, αναβαίνω, etc. Proper names are also omitted.

From this table it will be seen that Homer is a much better
preparation for the Greek drama, Hesiod, the elegiac and iambic
poets, than is Xenophon, and it is along these lines that the course
should be developed. For Plato the difference is so exceedingly
slight that in the matter of vocabulary one is practically as good a
preparation as the other, and a few of his easier dialogues should
find a place after some of the best poetry has been read. After
that the Greek course ought to be able to take care of itself. Herodotus
might come at any point. There is a slight advantage here
on the side of Xenophon in the matter of vocabulary, but his
language is so much closer to that of Homer, as well as his general
style and imaginative genius, that he would be very easy and
stimulating to those who had read any considerable amount of
Homeric Greek. Those who wished to read Thucydides and the
orators would find Xenophon’s vocabulary somewhat better for
their purpose, and the same is true if they wished to read the
New Testament and Menander; but in all these the advantage
is relatively slight, and in most cases the difference would probably
not be noticeable. In the case of the New Testament, for example,
the difference is less than one word in two Teubner pages of Greek
text.

It is generally recognized that for the best results in the study
of the New Testament, students should read a considerable amount
of other Greek first. In the whole circle of Greek literature the
two authors most important for the student of the New Testament
are Homer and Plato. Herodotus informs us that Homer and
Hesiod were the chief sources of the Greek popular religion; and

xxiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

certainly one cannot obtain a clear grasp of the forces opposed to
Christianity without a good knowledge of Homer and of the hold
that Homer had upon the popular mind. If one is to read intelligently
the works of the early church fathers, he must be well
acquainted at first hand with Homer. It is Homer, Homer’s
religion, and Homer’s gods which recur constantly in their works
and which are attacked over and over again as being the bulwarks of
the heathen faith which they are striving to supplant. Homer and
the ideas he represents are infinitely more important for the student
of the New Testament and of the early church than is Xenophon;
and if one can study not more than a year or so of Greek before
taking up the New Testament, he should by all means have some
Homer followed by Plato. Experience has shown that after a
year of Homer, students can and do pass with little difficulty
into the New Testament. The passage from Homer to Attic, or
to Hellenistic, Greek is of course a great deal easier than vice versa,
and occupies very little time and effort.

Some have urged that since the bulk of the work in the ordinary
college course in Greek is in the Attic dialect, students who begin
with this would get a firmer grasp of it than if they began with
Homer. Some even feel that a student who did his beginning
work in Homeric forms would never be able to feel thoroughly at
home in Attic Greek. Yet few teachers would be rash enough to
suggest that because a student has had a thorough""training in
Attic Greek he is thereby disqualified from doing first-class work
in the language of the Hellenistic period, nor would many teachers
of New Testament Greek, e.g., object to a student who wished
to specialize in their subject, or even in Patristic Greek, if he came
to them with a good knowledge of Plato. Students who wish to
specialize in Pliny and Tacitus, or even in Mediaeval Latin, do
not find themselves handicapped because they did their earlier
work in such authors as Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, and
Catullus. Teachers of the Romance languages also universally
recognize that a thorough course in Latin is a prerequisite for the
highest type of scholarship in their field, and no student could
hope to do advanced linguistic work in any of these languages

xxv
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

without a thorough training in Latin. In the same way Homer
offers an unexcelled preparation not only for all later Greek literature
but for the later language as well; and instead of the present
system of confusion in the teaching of Greek grammar, particularly
with reference to the various dialects, some attempt should be
made to develop the subject in a more scientific fashion.

Some feel that Homer is too beautiful and too exquisite to be
used as a corpus vile for the teaching of Greek grammar. But
the very fact that he is so beautiful and so exquisite is the very
reason why he should be used at this early stage, that the students
may have an added incentive for learning their grammar, and may
not come to hate and despise the whole subject. Thus they may
see, even from the beginning, that Greek is something worth
working at, and they may have material interesting enough that
the necessary grammatical drill will not seem so much useless
drudgery.

A highly important consideration in placing Homer before Xenophon
in the curriculum is the fact that as matters now stand such a
large per cent of our students never reach Homer. The problem
before us with regard to these students is whether we are to give
them Xenophon or Homer. Since they represent a very large
element, not all of whom are loafers either, we owe it to ourselves
and to the cause of Greek, as well as to them, to give them that
which will be of most lasting value to them.

Furthermore, Homer is interesting not only to older students, but
is particularly adapted to the youngest who now take Greek, as
the earliest experiments, made with boys from nine to fourteen
years of age, have amply demonstrated. He serves the double
purpose of introducing them adequately to the language and of
furnishing them with reading material as interesting as can be
found in any literature, something too of permanent value; and
he should come by all means as early as possible in the course, that
he may serve as a suitable basis for the development of those
qualities of taste and appreciation, without which the study of
all art is in vain. And after we have begun with him, we find his
treasures inexhaustible. In Herbart’s expressive phrase, “Homer

xxvi
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

elevates the student without depressing the teacher.” To quote
further from his lectures on education, he says (VI, 283) : “ The
reasons for giving the preference to Homer’s Odyssey in early instruction
are well known. Any one who reads the Odyssey carefully,
with an eye to the various main classes of interest which are
to be aroused by education, can discover the reasons. The point,
however, to be gained here is not merely to produce a direct effect,
but beyond that to get points of connection for progressive instruction.
There can be no better preparation for ancient history
than gaining interest for ancient Greece by the Homeric stories.
The ground is prepared for both the cultivation of taste and the
study of languages at the same time.

“Philologists will be obliged sooner or later to listen to reasons
of this kind, which are actually derived from the chief aim of all
instruction, and are only opposed by tradition (the conventional
study of Latin). This they must do, unless they desire that now,
with the growth of history and science, and the pressure of material
interests, Greek should be restricted in schools as Hebrew is at
present.

“ The Odyssey, it is true, possesses no magic power to animate
those who are entirely unsuccessful in languages, or who do not
work at them seriously; nevertheless it surpasses in definite educative
influence, as is proved by the experience of many years,
every other work of classic times that could be choserfi”

In conclusion the writer would earnestly suggest that it is high
time that Xenophon be omitted completely from at least the first
three years of Greek study. The time and labor now devoted to
both Xenophon and Homer should be spent on Homer alone, and
for the three books of the Iliad and the four books of the Anabasis
usually read should be substituted a course in Homer which would
be extensive enough to give the students a real insight into his
poetry, that they may learn to wander for themselves in the realms
of gold, that they may be allowed to become so familiar with his language
and his style that reading from him will be a pleasure and
not a lot of hard work to be waded through, that they may become
so filled with his spirit that they may catch a glimpse of what it

xxvii
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

means to be Homeric, and in later years, if they have gone out
into other fields and would like to turn back to Greek literature,
it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to bring out
their old book and enter again with delight into his world of song.
In the secondary schools we should have a course in Homer comprehensive
enough to enable the students to obtain a firm grounding
in his language and ideas, instead of the present smattering
of both Xenophon and Homer, neither of which the average student
knows well enough for it to serve as a stable and satisfactory basis
for future work. It would be a real step forward on the part of
the colleges, and should largely increase the number of those now
offering Greek for admission, if the requirements in Greek should
be made a requirement in Homer only, due attention being paid to
composition and grammar, of course. Thus the secondary schools
could intensify their efforts on one dialect and on one homogeneous
mass of literature, which would materially simplify their problems,
and ought to produce a much higher grade of work than is possible
at present. If colleges would admit students on one, two, and three
years, respectively, of Homer, with due credit for each, and reserve
all work in the Attic dialect for the college course proper,
the secondary teachers would have their burdens greatly lightened,
with a corresponding increase in effectiveness. In no other language
do the secondary schools undertake to prepare a student
in two separate dialects. To do so in Greek is a pedagogical
blunder which should be perpetuated no longer.
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

I

The Iliad and the Odyssey, the two great Greek epics, and the
greatest of all epic poems, belong to the earliest Greek literature
that has been preserved.

Their action and stories are legendary and are grouped around
the incidents concerning the long siege of Troy by the Greeks, its
final capture and destruction, and the return of the Greeks home.
No attempt is made to give a systematic account of those events,
but certain leading features of the legends are developed.

The Iliad, has for its central theme and as the thread upon which
it strings its various events the Menis, the mad anger of Achilles,
and its dire consequences to the Greeks.

According to the story, Paris, son of King Priam of Troy (Ilios)
in Asia Minor, eloped with Helen, the most beautiful woman in the
world, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, in southern Greece. The
Greeks united under the command of King Agamemnon of Mycenae,
brother of Menelaus, and the most powerful of the Greek chieftains,
to avenge this wrong, capture Troy, and bring back Helen.
After ten years of preparation they gathered their forces, sailed
across the Aegean to the shores of the Hellespont (Dardanelles),
landed, and drew up their ships, out of the water, in long lines on
the shore. For ten years the siege continued before the Greeks
were able to capture the city.

The Iliad opens, in the ninth year of the siege, with the deadly
quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles. Before all the assembled
Greeks, Agamemnon disgraces and humiliates Achilles, and robs
him of his prize of honor which had been previously bestowed
upon him by the army. In rage and disgust, Achilles retires from

xxix
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

the conflict and sulks in his tent. As he had been their stoutest
warrior, his absence is keenly felt by the Greeks, who suffer many
defeats and heavy losses at the hands of the Trojans, now that
Achilles has withdrawn. It is only the death of his bosom friend,
Patroclus, in battle, which furnishes a motive sufficiently powerful
to induce him to take a further part in the war. To avenge his
death, Achilles enters the conflict once more, and lulls Hector,
who had slain Patroclus. Shortly thereafter he was himself killed
by an arrow shot by Paris with the help of Apollo. Finally, in the
tenth year of the siege, Troy was captured by the Greeks, by
means of the well-known stratagem of the Wooden Horse. The
city was plundered and burned; the men were killed and the women
taken as slaves. Helen was recovered ; and after many adventures
and losses by shipwreck and other misfortunes the Greeks returned
home.

The traditional date of the fall of Troy was 1184 b.c. The date
of the Homeric poems is not at all certain. Some think they are
as early as 850 b.c., while others would date them as late as the
latter part of the seventh century B.C. Many scholars have
thought that the poems represent a gradual growth of a long period
of time, that they were composed by a number of different bards,
and'have been worked over, edited and re-edited, till they gradually
acquired their present form. Many of these scholars would deny
that any one by the name of Homer ever lived. Others think that
Homer was one of the editors, perhaps the most important of the
editors, of the poems, that he may have composed a considerable
amount of material in them, but that his chief function consisted
in combining and working over the various lays handed down by
his predecessors. Still others are of the opinion that the whole
of the poems, or practically all of them, as we have them, were
composed outright by a single poet, who was a real historical
character, and whose name was Homer. Most are agreed that
there must have been some great, master mind, whose influence is
felt throughout the poems, but who made free use of the work
of other poets who had preceded him and who had sung of various
events connected with the same theme. As Kipling would say:

XXX
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

W’en Omer smote ’is bloomin’ lyre,
’E’d ’eard men sing by land and sea,
And wot ’e thought ’e might require,
Έ went and took, the same as me.



The old Greeks were practically unanimous in believing that
the poems were composed by a bard, named Homer, and
that he traveled about, in various parts of Greece, a poor,
old, blind beggar, eking out an existence by singing his poems.
After his death, we are told that:	“	Seven	cities claimed the

Homer dead, through which
the living Homer begged his
bread.” The chief contestants
for the honor of his birthplace
were Smyrna and Chios,
and the evidence of the poems
would seem to point to that
region.

The poems represent a very
unsettled condition of society in
the Greek world, corresponding
in many ways to the Middle
Ages in Europe. Preceding this
period, there had been a brilliant
civilization in the Greek world
in the Aegean basin. This civilization
is generally called the

and Egyptian cultures. Other centers were Mycenae,

Argos, Athens, Pylus, and Sparta, in Europe, and Troy in Asia
Minor.

It was finally destroyed by invasions of barbarians from the
North, much as the Roman Empire finally succumbed to the
Germanic invasions. These invaders were the early Greeks, and
this period is usually called the Homeric Age, because so many of
its features are reflected in the Homeric poems, the Iliad and the
Odyssey.

The times were rude, and social life was primitive. War and
piracy were ordinary pursuits. The people grouped themselves
around powerful chieftains for protection, but marauding bands
were common, which killed, burned, and plundered. Personal
valor and prowess in battle were of supreme importance, not only
for one’s own safety, but for the safety and freedom of his friends
and family as well. Accordingly, the greatest virtue, and the
one held in highest esteem, was bravery in war.

For our picture of the culture of this period we are dependent
upon the Homeric poems. In them we see how expeditions were
made by the Greeks against their enemies, whom they considered
at all times as legitimate objects of plunder. Usually such expeditions
were under one of the many petty Homeric “kings.” Of
these there were a great number; and there was no unity and no
central authority in Homeric Greece any more than there were
in the later historical period.

According to the tradition, the expedition against Troy was
undertaken by the whole of Greece, united under the leadership
of Agamemnon. Some think that this tradition rests upon an
ultimate basis of fact; but this may be merely an idealistic touch,
expressing an earnest hope of the poet, that the various Greek
tribes may reconcile their differences and stop warring on each
other long enough to make war upon the common foe, the barbarians,
as represented by the non-Greek inhabitants of Asia
Minor. In the Homeric poems we find that although Agamemnon
was commander in chief of the allied Greek military expedition,
the various contingents were led by their own commanders, most
of whom were their kings, apparently quite independent of Aga-

brother, Menelaus, the wronged husband of Helen; the young,

the wily Odysseus (Ulysses) of Ithaca, who wandered for ten years
after the fall of Troy before he arrived safe at home and saw once
more his wife, the faithful Penelope; the huge and brutal Telamonian
Ajax of Salamis; the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus of Locris;

On the Trojan side the most important characters are: Hector,

brought on the war by stealing Helen; Glaucus and Sarpedon,
princes of Lycia, whose beautiful and unselfish friendship is only
matched by that of Achilles and Patroclus on the Greek side.

The divinities take an active part in the conflict, some siding
with the Greeks, the others with the Trojans. Zeus, who stands

xxxiii
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

at the head of the gods, as father and king of gods and men, seems
inclined to be neutral. Hera his wife, queen of the gods, cherishes
an implacable hatred against the Trojans, as does Athena, his
daughter, goddess of war, wisdom, and the arts. Poseidon, brother
of Zeus, the mighty god of the sea, is also on the side of the Greeks,
and loses no opportunity to help them. On the Trojan side were
Apollo, god of light, who wards off darkness and evil, patron of
music, poetry and healing; Artemis, his sister, a divinity of the
moonlight, goddess of the woods and wild animals, and patroness
of the chase; Leto, their mother; Aphrodite, born of the white
sea-foam, goddess of love and beauty, who had assisted Paris in
obtaining Helen; Hephaestus, the lame god of fire, patron of all
useful mechanical arts and the working of metals; and the rivergod
Scamander, a stream near Troy.

The gods are distinctly human in their characteristics and
attributes, with human appetites and passions. They differ from
men primarily in being more powerful and in being immortal.
They enjoy a good dinner, where they feast on nectar and ambrosia;
they love and hate, are envious and jealous, but on the whole live
a .happier and serener life than mortals.

In translating Homer, it would be well to hold in mind the four
essential characteristics of his poetry as enumerated by Matthew
Arnold: “ Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his
words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble
in his manner.”

For a good characterization of the Homeric poems, from the
point of view of literary art, one should by all means read Andrew
Lang’s Essay, “ Homer and the Study of Greek,” from which the
following is taken. “Homer is a poet for all ages, all races, and
all moods. To the Greeks the epics were not only the best of
romances, the richest of poetry; not only their oldest documents
about their own history — they were also their Bible, their treasury
of religious traditions and moral teaching. With the Bible and
Shakespeare, the Homeric poems are the best training for life.
There is no good quality that they lack : manliness, courage, reverence
for old age and the hospitable hearth; justice, piety, pity, a

<pb/>INTRODUCTION

brave attitude toward life and death, are all conspicuous in Homer.
He has to write of battles; and he delights in the joy of battle,
and in all the movements of war. Yet he delights not less, but
more, in peace: in prosperous cities, hearths secure, in the tender
beauty of children, in the love of wedded wives, in the frank nobility
of maidens, in the beauty of earth and sky and sea and seaward
murmuring river, in sun and snow, frost and mist and rain, in the
whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and pine tree.

“ living in an age when every man was a warrior, where every
city might know the worst of sack and fire, where the noblest ladies

Storeroom in the Palace at Gnossls

might be led away for slaves, to light the fire and make the bed of
a foreign master, Homer inevitably regards life as a battle. To
each man on earth comes ‘ the wicked day of destiny,’ as Malory
unconsciously translates it, and each man must face it hardily as
he may.

“ Homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and honor.
His heart is with the brave of either side — with Glaucus and Sarpedon
of Lycia no less than with Achilles and Patroclus. ‘Ah
friend,’ cries Sarpedon, ‘if once escaped from this battle we were
for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I myself fight

xxxv
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

now in the foremost ranks, nor would I urge thee into the wars that
give renown; but now — for assuredly ten thousand fates of
death on every side beset us, and these may no man shun, nor avoid
— forward let us go, whether we are to give glory or to win it.’
And forth they go, to give and take renown and death, all the
shields and helmets of Lyeia shining behind them, through the
dust of battle, the singing of arrows, the hurtling of spears, the
rain of stones from the Locrian slings. And shields are smitten,
and chariot-horses run wild, with no man to drive them, and Sarpedon
drags down a portion of the Achaean battlement, and Aias
leaps into the trench with his deadly spear, and the whole battle
shifts and shines beneath the sun. Yet he who sings of the war,
and sees it with his sightless eyes, sees also the Trojan women
working at the loom, cheating their anxious hearts with broidery
work of gold and scarlet, or raising the song to Athena, or heating
the bath for Hector, who never again may pass within the gates of
Troy. He sees the poor weaving woman, weighing the wool, that
she may not cheat her employers, and yet may win bread for her
children. He sees the children, the golden head of Astyanax, his
shrinking from the splendor of the hero’s helm. He sees the child
Odysseus, going with his father through the orchard, and choosing
out some apple trees*‘for his very own.’ It is in the mouth of the
ruthless Achilles, the fatal, the fated, the swift-footed hero of
the hands of death, that Homer places the tenderest of his similes.
‘Wherefore weepest thou, Patroclus, like a fond little maid that
runs by her mother’s side, praying her mother to take her up,
snatching at her gown, and hindering her as she walks, and tearfully
looking at her till her mother takes her up ? — Like her,
Patroclus, dost thou fondly weep.’ . . . Such are the moods of
Homer, so full of love of life and all things living, so rich in all
human sympathies, so readily moved when the great hound Argus
welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but the
hound knew him, and died in that welcome. With all this love
of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of
armor, of implement of art; on the divers-colored gold work of the
shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the forging of

xxxvi
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

iron, on the rose-tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on cooking and
eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and their ways, on
fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths where fair maidens
lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered isles with good harbors
and rich land, on plowing, mowing, and sowing, on the furniture of
houses, on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is
laid, — with all this delight in the real, Homer is the most romantic
of poets. He walks with the surest foot in the
darkling realm of dread Persephone, beneath
the poplars of the last beach of Ocean. He has
heard the siren’s music, and the song of Circe,
chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the
golden shuttle through the loom of gold. He
enters the cave of the man-eater; he knows
the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; in the
summer of the North he has looked, from the
fiord of the Laestrygons, on the midnight sun.

He has dwelt on the floating isle of Aeolus,
with its wall of bronze unbroken, and has sailed
on those Phaeacian barks that need no help
of helm or oar, that fear no stress either of
wind or tide, that come and go and return,
obedient to a thought and silent as a dream.

He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters
of wells and woods, and of sacred streams. He
is the second-sighted man, and beholds the
shroud that wraps the living who are doomed, and the mystic
dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed. He has walked in
the garden closes of Phaeacia and looked on the face of gods who
fare thither and watch the weaving of the dance. He has eaten
the honey-sweet fruit of the Lotus, and from the hand of Helen
he brings us that Egyptian Nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of
the mind. His real world is as real as that of Eenry V., his enchanted
isles are charmed with the magic of the Tempest. His
young wooers are as insolent as Claudio, as flushed with youth;
his beggar-men are brethren of Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is

xxxvii
<pb/>HOMERIC GREEK

sister to Rosalind, with a different charm of stately purity in love.
His enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is
very beauty; she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and
her repentance is without remorse. His Achilles is youth itself,
glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and loving, and
conscious of its doom. Homer, in truth, is to be matched only
by Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not the occasional
willfulness, freakishness, and modish obscurity. He is a poet
all of gold, universal as humanity, simple as childhood, musical
now as the flow of his own rivers, now as the heavy plunging wave
of his own ocean. . . .

“Such then, as far as weak words can speak of him, is the first
and greatest of poets.”

Vocabulary. — One of the things most important in learning any
language so as to be able to read it with profit and pleasure is to
acquire a fair-sized vocabulary. In doing this, one should learn
thoroughly the words that are used most. For this purpose there
is a highly practical little book, Homeric Vocabularies, Owen
and Goodspeed, published by the University of Chicago Press.
The most common Homeric words are arranged in it in groups,
according to frequency of occurrence. A copy of this book should
be in the hands of every student who wishes to lighten his work in
learning to read and enjoy Homer.

Forms of the Greek Verb. — In learning the Greek verb, the most
difficult part of Greek grammar, it is highly important to know
which forms are most essential. The following material, with the
two tables, compiled by Professor Robbins, will indicate where the
stress of work should come. These tables will be found valuable,
not only for Homeric Greek, but for other Greek as well. By
emphasizing strongly the forms which are most common, it will
be found that the work will be materially lightened, and the
Greek verb will not be found at all formidable.

“ Table I tabulates the result of counting the verb forms found
on ten pages each of Homer, Euripides, Herodotus, Demosthenes,

xxxviii
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

and Plato, and on twenty of Xenophon (ten each from the Anabasis
and the Memorabilia). In most cases the pages of the Oxford
Classical Texts or the Bibliotheca Teubneriana have been made
the unit, and for the present purpose the variation in the amount of
Greek on the page need cause no concern. It may be remarked,
also, that first and second perfects have been counted together
because they are best taught together, and that the present
participle of dpi has been included among the thematic present
participles.1

“The revelations of Table I make clear a few points that have a
definite bearing on the teaching of Greek. In the first place, it
shows that a large majority of the verbs one meets in reading
Greek are confined to a small group of forms. Table II will make
this clearer; it will then appear that nine or ten forms make up
over a half, and twenty-four forms three-quarters, of the verbs
in average Greek. Is it not right that we should first concern
ourselves with teaching these forms ? Of course, one must not
guide himself entirely by these, or any similar, statistics; often it
is advantageous to teach a whole group together, even though this
involves the introduction of certain rather rare forms together with
others that are commoner. On the other hand, here we have a
definite, practical ground for demanding that certain forms be
introduced very early.

“ Among these the present active participle deserves special^
mention. The statistics show the high frequency of its occurrence,
and indeed few sentences, save the most elementary, can be mastered
without a knowledge of it. Furthermore, its inflection can
easily be made an introduction to both the first and third declensions,
and one should not readily pass by an opportunity to kill
three birds with one stone.

“ The apparently high frequency of the present and imperfect
indicative and the present infinitive of -μι verbs is due not so
much to ΐστημι, τίθημι, δίδώμι, and SeiKvupt as to the constant 1

1	“ Another liberty which I have taken is to disregard perfects of the
-μι form, reckoning all perfects together. Aorists like ϊβην are counted as
-μι forms.”

occurrence of forms of άμί and φημ-ί {ίστί, άσί, ην, ησαν, ctrat,
ίφη). These particular forms are entitled to an early hearing in
the classroom and are probably best taught separately, as indeed
they usually are, the other athematic verbs being postponed.

“ In Table II there have been set down the twenty-four forms
which occur most frequently, with the percentage of their occurrence
in ordinary Greek.

“ From Table II, which is based upon Table I and is really a
summary of the most important facts to be gleaned from Table I,
one might conclude that the student should as soon as possible be
put in command of the present, imperfect, first and second aorist,
perfect, and future indicative, the present and first and second aorist,
infinitive and participle, at least the active present optative, subjunctive,
and imperative, άμί in full, and some forms of Φημί;
with these mastered, he will have to depend on the teacher or notes
in the textbook for only a quarter of the verb forms he sees, and
of course this proportion will be cut down as he progresses.”

62.	Iliad, 1-5.



Note. — Observe that the long doubtful vowels (519) are not
marked in the Homeric passages (520), as their length must be learned
from the metre.

63.	
1. 

μἦνιν is emphatic, by position, as the central theme of the Iliad. It is the mad wrath of Achilles, and its terrible consequences to the Greeks, which the poet uses as a thread for his plot. —
 ἀείδε [άειδω] : pres. act. imperat., 2d sing., sing, i.e. inspire me with thy gift of song, 1069. — 
θεά (the muse of song) is vocative. — 
Πηληιάδεω = Πηληιάδᾱο 573 (probably Πηληιάδᾱ’ Ἀχιλῆος stood here originally).

2. οὐλομένην is emphatic as being at the bead of the verse, and at the
end of its clause, and out of the natural order. It is in a kind of apposition
with μῆνιν, as though it were an afterthought, and is expanded and

<pb n="22"/>

amplified by the following clause. — 

ἥ [ὅs, ἥ, ὅ 773] refers to μῆνιν- —
μῡρί’ Ἀχαιοῖς : for the hiatus see 576 ; 1178, 3.

3.	Merely a picturesque way of saying “killed.” — 

προΐαψεν: 830-831, 837.—

Ἄιδι, = ἌϜιδι. To the ancient Greeks the realm of Hades
was not primarily a place of punishment, of tortures, and of horrors, as
the Christian Hell, but was a faint and cheerless copy of the upper world,
and was the abode of all departed spirits of the dead. Consequently no
one, no matter how good and pious, was anxious to die.

4.	ἡρώων is emphatic, as coming at the beginning of the verse, and
out of its natural order. — 

δὲ ἑλώρια = δε Ϝελώρια (580). — 

αὐτούς : themselves, i.e. their bodies, as contrasted with their shadows, or souls.

τεῦχε = ἔτευχε : 837. In order for the soul of the deceased to obtain rest,
it was necessary that the body be buried, or cremated, with the proper
funeral rites. If the enemy gained possession of his foe’s body, as a
mark of the worst he could do, he might give it over to the dogs and
birds to devour. This heightened the pathos of the poet’s theme. The
scene on the opposite page shows how bitterly the old Greeks and Trojans
fought for the bodies of the slain. Achilles, who has been shot through
the heel by Paris, lies dead in the midst of the fray. The Trojans have
pounced upon his body, eager to drag it within their own lines. Glaucus,
one of their number, while attempting to tie a thong to the foot of
Achilles, falls mortally wounded by Ajax, who is stoutly defending the
corpse. Other Trojans, including Paris, Aeneas, Laodocus, and Echippus,
have joined in the battle.

5.	ἐτελεῖετο [τελείω] : imperf. pass, indic., 3d sing., was being accomplished.

These verses, together with the two following, form the prooemium,
or introduction to the Iliad. The subject is announced in the very first
word (μῆνις). It is the wrath of Achilles and its disastrous consequences
to the Greeks, but all in accordance with the will of Zeus,
which form the principal theme of the poem.

64.	Translate :

1.	The valiant Achaeans are singing the accursed wrath of Achilles. 

2. The wrath of Achilles caused many woes to the Achaeans and sent many valiant souls of heroes to the god Hades. 

3. We shall make the army of the Achaeans a booty for the dogs and a banquet for the birds. 

4. We are accomplishing the will of the goddess.

LESSON XIV: PROSODY. THE GREEK HEXAMETER

Iliad, 1-5

65.	1) Read carefully the sections on quantity and prosody, 519-526 and 1159-1192.

2)	Copy and mark the scansion of the first five verses of the Iliad.

66.	Remember that the only vowels the quantity of which
is not known are α, ι, υ and that their length is indicated in
the vocabulary. As soon as possible the student should
master the rules for the length of vowels of the inflectional
endings, so as to be free from the vocabulary in this particular.

67.	In marking the scansion of these verses, use the sign
(ˉ) to indicate a long syllable, and the sign (˘) for a short
syllable, separating the feet from each other by the perpendicular
line ( | )·

68.	The written word-accent must be disregarded in reading
the verse.

69.	Iliad	1-5

Μηνιν αειδε, θεά, ΤΙηΧηιάδεω Ά^ιΧηος	1

ούΧομενην, ἡ μυρί’ Άχαιοΐς αΧΓγε’ εθηκεν,

ηρώων, αυτούς δε εΧώρια τενχε κύνεσσιν

οίωνοΐσί τε δαΐτα, Ἀιος 8’ ετεΧείετο βουΧή,	5

70.	The first syllable of μῆνιν must be long, having a long
vowel, 522. The accent shows that the second syllable must
be short, 545, 1160. Then, having one long and one short,
the next syllable (ἄ-) must be short, as when there is one
long followed by a short, there must be another short to
complete the foot, 1169.

The next syllable (-ει-) is long, being a diphthong, 521-522.

<pb n="24"/>

The next syllable (-δε) is short, having a short vowel followed
by a single consonant.

The next syllable (θε-) is short also, having a short vowel
followed by another vowel.

As this completes this foot, the final syllable (-ά) of θεά .
must be long, as it is the first, syllable of the next foot, 1171.

The next syllable (Πη-) is long, having a long vowel, 522.

The next syllable (-λη-) is long, having a long vowel, 522.

The next vowel (-ι-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-ά-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next vowel (-ε-) is short, but as the first syllable of a
foot must be long, 1171, the -δεω is pronounced as one long
syllable, by synizesis, 586.

The next vowel (Ἀ-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-χι-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-λῆ-) is long, having a long vowel.

The final syllable (-ος) is short, having a short vowel, but
must be marked long here, as the final syllable is always long,
owing to the pause in the verse, 1184.

Therefore the metrical scheme of this verse is:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |


Now mark the next verse : οὐλομένην, ἣ μῡρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε’
ἔθηκεν,

The first syllable (οὐ-) is long, being a diphthong.

The second syllable (-λο-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-μέ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-νην) is long, having a long vowel.

The next (ἣ) is long, having a long vowel.

As this completes the second foot, the next syllable (μυ-)
must be long, as it is the first syllable of the next foot.

The next syllable (-ρί’) is short, as is indicated by the accent,
since only short vowels are elided, 575, 1162.

<pb n="25"/>

Then the next syllable (Ἀ-) must be short, to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-χαι-) is long, having a diphthong.

The next syllable (-οῖς) is long, having a diphthong.

The next-syllable (ἄλ-) is long,followed by two consonants.

The next syllable (-γε’) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (ἔ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (-θη-) is long, having a long vowel.

The next syllable (-κεν) is short, but is long here, owing
to its place in the verse, 1184.

Therefore this verse should be scanned as follows:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |

71.	Using these principles, and the rules given, 1159-1192,
mark the scansion of the first five verses, and do not attempt
any further work in Homer till these have been thoroughly
memorized and can be repeated rhythmically with ease.

72.	A good plan to follow at first is to mark only the syllables
of which the quantity is certain, without having to
consult the vocabulary. When this is done, the quantity of
the remaining syllables can usually be determined from their
position in the verse.

73.	Before attempting to memorize a verse, it should always
be translated several times, till the student is quite
familiar with the exact meaning of every word and understands
accurately every construction in it.

74.	First the teacher may repeat these verses a few times
for the students, then with them, till they have the movement
mastered, but after that the students should be able to
recite them alone.

75.	Let each student recite these separately, then let them
be repeated by small groups, and finally in concert by the
entire class.

76.	In repeating these verses orally, the words must of
course be kept distinct and no break must be made between

the separate feet, unless there is a pause in sense, caesura, 1185, or diaeresis, 1188.

77.	Careful attention must be paid to the meaning of the
passage, and the various pauses should be indicated by the
voice. Of course the voice must not be allowed to drop at
the end of a verse unless there is a distinct pause there.

LESSON XV: THIRD DECLENSION (Continued)

78.	1) Learn the declension of

83.	6. οὗ [ὅs, ἥ, ὅ, 773], ἐξ οὗ, referring back to ἄειδε from the time when,

literally, from what [time]. — το πρώτα : 781-782. — διαστήτην = διεστήτην, 837 [διίστημι]. — ἐρίσαντε [ἐρίζω] : aor. active participle, nom., dual,
masc., (they two) having quarreled.

7 is in apposition with the subject of διαστήτην. The son of Atreus is
Agamemnon, commander-in-chief of the allied Greek military expedition
against Troy, undertaken to bring back Helen, wife of Menelaus, brother
of Agamemnon: she had been stolen away from her home in Greece by
Paris, son of Priam, and was now in Troy. — τε ἄναξ = τε Ϝάναξ, 580.

<pb n="28"/>

The son of Atreus was so well known to Homer’s hearers, it was not
necessary to give his name, Agamemnon.

8.	This verse is a rhetorical question, addressed by the poet to his
audience, to arouse attention and curiosity, and which he then answers
himself: a common device of public speakers. — σφωε [ἕο]: 3d pers.
pron., acc. dual, these two. ·— ἔριδι: 1009. — μάχεσθαι [μάχομαι] : pres. act.
infinitive, deponent, to fight.

9.	βασιλῆι: 996. — χολωθείς [χολόω] : aor. pass, particip., nom. sing,
masc. (modifies ὀ), having been enraged,. — Λητοῦς = Λητόος, 584-585. —
βασιλῆι = Ἀγαμέμνονι. — Λητοῦs καὶ Διὸς υἱός  = Ἀπόλλων, who was mediately
the cause of the quarrel, since he brought a plague upon the
Greeks, which gave occasion for the strife between Achilles and Agar
memnon.

10.	voῦσov is emphatic by position, as is κακήν, which is further explained
and expanded by the following clause. — ὀλέκοντο = ὠλέκοντο,
837 [ὀλέκω], imperf. pass, indic., 3d plur., were being destroyed, kept perishing.
— λαοί: the soldiers in the Greek army.

On the first seven verses, read 63 (end), and compare Hermann Grimm :
“ These first verses are like the tones of a funeral march rising to a sky
shrouded with gloomy clouds. A series of verses which like heralds
announce the whole poem. A gloomy cloud gathers over the Greeks.
The field is covered with the corpses of fallen heroes. Dogs and vultures
tear the bodies of the slain. The most powerful of men and the mightiest
mortal descendant of Zeus quarrel. Zeus has determined the destruction
of the people. All this in a single sentence which closes with
Ἀχιλλεύς.”

With fine poetic insight Homer begins his story in the very middle
with a thrilling situation, and allows the background with what has gone
before to unfold itself gradually, as it is needed, in the course of his
narrative.

In order to create a situation which would inevitably bring on a quarrel
so far-reaching in its consequences, it is not enough for merely human
factors and natural causes to operate, but some divinity must motivate
the action. This gives the poet a wider range for his creative imagination,
and makes anything possible.

familiar to the hearers of the bard. 

—ἠτίμασev [ἀτιμάζω], 

ἀρητῆρα: 1182.
Observe that this verse ends in two spondees, making it a “spondaic”
verse. This, together with the position of the final word, throws special
emphasis upon it, making it practically equivalent to “ although he was
a priest,” which would of course make him an object of more than ordinary
reverence.

12.	Ἀτρεΐδης  is made distinctly emphatic by position. It is he who
must bear the burden of responsibility in slighting the priest. — 

ἐπὶ νῆας, i.e. to the Greek camp on the shore, where they had drawn up their
ships, out of the water.

13. λῡσόμενος [λύω]: fut. mid. particip., nom. sing. masc. (modifying
ὁ, which refers to the priest) peing about (desiring) to ransom, to ransom,
1109, 5. — 

φέρων [φέρω] : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (also modifies
ὀ), bearing, bringing.—

ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα is an example of epic exaggeration, not rare in all such compositions.

14.	ἔχων [ἔχω] : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (modifies ὁ), having,
holding. The ransoms were probably of gold and silver bullion and other
valuable articles of commerce.

The priest depends upon two motives to influence the Greeks:

1)	Cupidity, and so he brings the presents, ἄποινα.

2)	Reverence, which accounts for his wearing the fillets (ribbons of
white wool) and bearing the. sceptre as insignia of his office.

— χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου: originally χερσὶ Ϝεκηβόλου. — 

ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος : 571, 1173. Apollo has the epithet “free-shooter,” “sharp-shooter” applied
to him here, introducing him in his capacity as archer god, so
important for the further action, where he slays the Greeks with his
arrows. In his capacity as god of war, Jehovah was also an archer god
at times. “God is a righteous judge. He hath bent his bow and made
it ready.” Compare the story of the rainbow: “I shall set my bow (i.e.
my symbol as warrior god) in the cloud.”

15.	χρῡσ-έῳ : synizesis, 586. — 

χρῡσέω ἀνά : 1173. — 

καὶ ἐλίσσετο : 1173.
The latter part of this verse would imply that the scene takes place at a
meeting of the assembly of the Greeks.

The sceptre was a symbol of authority. Of course it was of gold if it
is to appear decently in epic. The whole atmosphere of a poem of this
kind is supramundane. Its leading characters are divine or semi-divine,
and their equipment must all be of more precious material than that

<pb n="32"/>

which suffices for ordinary mortals. Thus Apollo has a golden sword.
Several of the warriors before Troy have golden armor, and the gods
sit on golden thrones which rest upon the golden pavements of their
palaces in Olympus. In the same way the new Jerusalem has streets
of gold and gates of pearl. — 

ἐλίσσετο  [λίσσομαι] : imperf. act. ind. 3d sing, deponent verb. Observe the force of the imperfect, the old priest
kept entreating Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus, but Agamemnon,
in spite of these repeated opportunities to avail himself of the mercy of
the god, chose deliberately to slight his holy ambassador.

16. Ἀτρεΐδᾱ = Menelaus and Agamemnon.

The priest is a native of Chrysa, a small town near Troy, which has
been plundered by the invading Greeks. His daughter has been taken
prisoner of war, and he now comes to the Greek camp, where the ships
have been drawn up on the shore, to ransom her.

μέν : correlative with δέ, vs. 20. — 

δοῖεν [δίδωμι] : aor. act. optative, 3d plur.
(its subject is θεοί), may they grant. — 

ἔχοντες [ἔχω] : pres. act. part.,
nom. plur. masc. (modifies θεοί), having, possessing, i.e. inhabiting. The
gods lived in palaces on the top of Olympus, a high mountain in
northern Thessaly. See note on vs. 44, § 138.

19.	ἐκπέρσαι [ἐκπέρθω] : aor. act. inf., to sack utterly. — 

ἱκέσθαι [ἱκνέομαι] : aor. act. inf., to arrive. — 

πόλιν : 1167, 1.

20.	From its position in the verse παῖδα is emphatic. “ It is my child
for whom I make my entreaties.” Observe how the addition of φίλην
heightens the pathos of the old man’s plea. — λῦσαι, δέχεσθαι: aor., and
pres. act. inff., used as imperatives, 1107, 11, free and accept. Observe
the rhyme of δέχεσθαι. with ἱκέσθαι in vs. 19. The old priest would thus
emphasize that their return home, ἱκέσθαι, may depend upon their acceptance,
δέχεσθαι, of the ransoms.—τά: these: the priest evidently points
to the gifts he had brought.

18 ff. ὑμῖν θεοὶ δοϊεν, etc.: “ may you get your wish, I mine.” Evidently
he does not object to having the Greeks collect part of their
payment from Priam and his people, who were of considerably less concern
to the priest than his own darling daughter. Homer’s characters
are often thus refreshingly individualistic. If the Greeks would grant his
request, he was willing to have his prayers enlisted on their side. He
was not the first, nor yet the last, to labor under the impression that the
outcome of a great war might be influenced by a personal appeal to his
god.

Instead of having his speech reported at second hand, the priest is
dramatically brought forward in propria persona, and speaks for himself.
The poet thus secures a more striking effect than indirect discourse
could produce.

21.	ἁζόμενοι [ἅζομαι] : pres. act. part., nom. plur. masc. (modifying
the implied subjects of λῦσαι and δέχεσθαι), reverencing. 21 is a spondaic
verse, 1182 ; “ honor the god,” i.e. in the person of me, his representative,
for to insult the priest would be to insult the god. The close of
his plea is made particularly impressive by ending in a spondaic verse
with the name of the god. Perhaps his use of the term ἑκηβόλον is

<pb n="35"/>

intended to convey a half-veiled threat. That is, if they do not grant
his prayer and thus refuse reverence to the god, Apollo in his character
of free-shooter may wreak vengeance upon them.

1.	The gods who have (ἔχοντες) Olympian homes will grant to the sons of Atreus and to the other well-greaved Achaeans to sack utterly (ἐκπέρσαι) the city of Priam.

To get the full effect of this situation, it must be, remembered that
the girl had been captured by the marauding Greeks, on a pillaging
expedition near Troy, and in the distribution of the booty she had
fallen to the lot of Agamemnon, whose personal property she now is.
So the old priest has little difficulty in winning over “ all the other
Achaeans,” who vociferously assent to his proposition ; but Agamemnon,
the only one who has anything to lose by the transaction, does not
prove to be so easy. Apparently he was not yet ready to return a choice
prize in exchange for a few pieces of gold and silver, or some old pots aud
pans and the paltry prayers of a pious priest. The piety of the other
Greeks and their reverence for the priest are placed in marked contrast
to the action of Agamemnon, who alone is wicked, and obstinately so.
His course is further robbed of any possible redeeming feature by the

<pb n="39"/>110-112]



fact that he is not only an ungodly sinner, but is actually rude and ill-mannered
to the priest. In requital for all this, as we shall learn in the
sequel, the people are the chief sufferers, who perish in heaps, while
Agamemnon escapes the plague. This is really an artistic blemish and
offends one’s sense of poetic justice. But it is necessary for the later
development of the plot that the king be preserved alive, and besides
throughout all history “ when the king sins the people suffer.” For an
illuminating parallel, read 2 Sam. 24 inter alia.

Agamemnon is too angry to consider any of the points urged by the
priest, and does not even thank him for his prayer for the success of the
expedition and a safe journey homeward (vss. 18-19), but takes that
all for granted (see vs. 30, next lesson). He respects neither god nor
priest, and prefers the girl to the ransom. In addressing the priest curtly

HOMERIC GREEK

34.	βή = ἔβη. — ἀκέων . . . πολυφλοίσ-βοιο are brought into intentional
contrast. This word, descriptive of the roaring, tossing sea, is
perhaps chosen to symbolize the endless tumult in the soul of the priest,
as distinguished from his outward calm, πολυφλοίσβοιο is an onomatopoetic
word, i.e. the sound of the word suggests and imitates the meaning,
so that by using this expression the poet makes his auditors hear
the sea roar. Cf.:

Poluphloisboisterous Homer of old
Threw all his augments into the sea,
Although he had often been courteously told
That perfect imperfects begin with an e.
But the Poet replied with a dignified air,
“ What the Digamma does any one care ? ”

35. πολλὰ : 780-781.—

ἠρᾶθ’ = ἠρᾶτο = ἠράετο [ἀράομαί], 575, 582,

ἀπάνευθε: of course the old priest has a very practical reason
in going at least far enough away that Agamemnon may not overhear.

τόν : relative,

37.	κλῦθι [*κλεύω]: aor. act. imperat., 2d sing., hear! — 

μευ [ἐγώ] : gen. sing., 984. — 

άργυρότοξ’(ε)  is of course vocative. The use of this
epithet instead of the name indicates how intimate the priest was with
the god whom he served. “ Come, O Lord, with thy silver bow ! ” By
calling upon him in his capacity as archer god, the priest already has in
mind the kind of answer he desires to his prayer. He would have the
god slay the Greeks with his arrows. Naturally the bow of Apollo must
be of precious metal, as befits the dignity of a god. Read again the
note on vs. 15, § 90. — 

ἀμφιβέβηκας : the perfect is to be translated as a present, dost protect. It is the figure of a warrior bestriding a fallen
comrade, or of an animal bestriding its young, in the face of danger, for
protection.

130.	38. Τενέδοιο : 985. — 

ζαθέην: Cilla is called “ holy,” as containing
a temple or sacred precinct which the god loved to frequent. Thus Jerusalem
was the “ holy city ” of Jehovah, since it contained the house
(temple) in which he dwelt, and there are some to-day who still call
Palestine the “Holy Land.” — 

ἀνάσσεις: art protecting lord. — 

τε Ϝῖφι Ϝανάσσεις.<note n="grc">this is a substition for what is in the text, showing lost digammas.</note>

39.	ἐπὶ . . . ἔρεψα: 1049. The part the old priest took in building
the temple may have involved no more work than the superintending of
the job, while ordinary people performed the labor.—

τοι [συ]: dat. sing., for thee. — 

Σμινθεῦ: as in vs. 37 the priest calls upon the god by
his title of ἀργυρότοξος, thereby intimating that he should bring along
his bow, so here he evidently has a purpose in mind by calling upon him
by his title of Smintheus, mouse god. For the old Greeks, probably
without knowing the scientific basis, recognized the connection of mice
with plagues. (Compare the spread of the bubonic plague by means of
rats.) Thus Apollo with his mice could bring a deadly plague upon
whomsoever he chose. The Philistines also, who are to be connected
with the early Greek and Trojan civilizations through Crete, their
former home, associated mice with plagues. “ And the Philistines took
the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. . . . But
the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed
them, and smote them with tumours, even Ashdod and the coasts

<pb n="48"/>

thereof. ... So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go
again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was
a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there. And the men that died not were smitten with the tumours:
and the cry of the city went up to heaven. And the Philistines called
for the priests and diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of
Jehovah ? Tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. And they
said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty;
but in any wise return him a trespass offering. . . . Then said they,
What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?
They answered, Five golden tumours and five golden mice, according to
the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you
all, and on your lords. Wherefore you shall make images of your
tumours and of the mice that mar the land.”

Another example of this sort is to be found in the account of the
destruction of the hosts of Sennacherib, which was doubtless due to a
plague of some sort. According to the Biblical narrative, “It came to
pass that night that the angel of Jehovah went out, and smote in the
camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and
when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead
corpses.” Herodotus, the early Greek historian, who traveled in Egypt
some two hundred and fifty years later, gives an account of this same
event, but associates the destruction with mice. However, in this two
hundred and fifty years the mice have risen from ordinary pest carriers
till in the narrative of Herodotus they assume an active and intelligent
part in cooperation with the Egyptian armies against the common foe.
By a night attack they fall upon their unwary enemies, and while the
army slept they gnawed their bow strings and shield straps, so that in
the morning, finding their armor useless, the hosts flee in terror, and
countless numbers of them perish in the rout that follows.

40.	τοι [συ] : dat. sing., for thee. — 

κατὰ . . . ἔκηα : 1049.

41.	μοι [ἐγώ] : dat. sing., for me. —

42.	τίσειαν [τίνω]: aor. act. optative, 3d plur., may they atone for!


βέλεσσιν : 1005. —

Δαναοὶ seems to be used as a name for the Greeks in
Homer, with no particular distinction in meaning from Ἀχαιοί or
Ἀργεῖοι.

The burden of the priest’s prayer (vss. 37-42) is: “I have placed you
under great obligations; so you ought to do this little favor for me.”

In a sacrifice of this kind the priest burned choice bits of the animal

<pb n="49"/>

to the god as a banquet to him. The god obtained this as it came up
to him in the smoke that rose to heaven (cf. Gen. viii, 20-21, etc.). — 

μηριά (vs. 40) were the thigh-pieces, the bones with the marrow and some
meat. The marrow of the bones was looked upon as a special delicacy.
Observe how specific the priest is in enumerating the favors he has
conferred upon his god. “ I have built for you a shrine, for your pleasure,
and I have served to you the best thigh-pieces I could get, together
with the bones and marrow, and I swear that they had plenty of fat on
them too.”

In vss. 39-42 observe the rhyming effect produced by the repetition
of the οι sound in these verses, which brings these words (τοι, τοι, μοι,
Δαναοί<note n="grc">another place where we can use very precise annotations to specify the particular instance of  a string/token</note>) into special prominence: “If I have done thy wish for thee, then
thou shouldst do my wish for me.” The priest has done so many favors
for the god that now the god ought to do something for the priest, and
avenge his wrongs by slaying the Danaans. If we were in the realm of
reason instead of poetry, with its artistic requirements and its necessities
for the furtherance of the plot, we might ask why the old man does not
request the god to punish Agamemnon directly, which would have been
a much easier task, and might have been expected to produce the desired
results with more certainty.

LESSON XXIII: THE SUBJUNCTIVE MODE OF VERBS

Iliad, 43-47

132.	The subjunctive has only the present, aorist, and
perfect tenses. The perfect is seldom found. In all tenses
the subjunctive has the primary (816) endings.

<pb n="50"/>

133.	Learn the conjugation of the active, middle and
passive, subjunctive of λύω, 905, 911, observing that the
thematic vowel (796) sometimes called the mode vowel, which
is short in the indicative, regularly becomes long in the subjunctive.
That is, ε and ο in the indicative regularly become
η and ω in the subjunctive. Thus λύομεν, λύετε, λύομαι,
λύεαι, λύεται, λυόμεθα, etc., of the indicative regularly become
λύωμεν, λύητε, λύωμαι, λύηαι, λύηται, λυώμεθα, etc., in
the subjunctive, 799-800.

138.	43. ἔφατ’ [φημί],—

τοῦ: 984. — 

Φοίβου : bright, shining; Apollo was god of light.

44.	βή = ἔβη [βαίνω], set out. The gods live on Olympus, a high
mountain in northern Thessaly, just as the favorite home of Jehovah for a
long time was on Mt. Sinai, although he might frequent any high mountain,
as Carmel, Lebanon, or Tabor. In a very real sense heaven lay
about the human race in its infancy, in that it was supposed to be quite
near, so near in fact that if one would shout loud enough his god(s) could
hear him. Thus when one prayed, he commonly cried out with a loud
voice. “ Then stood upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried
with a loud voice to Jehovah their god.” It was thought quite possible
to erect a structure high enough that one might step out of it right into
heaven. “ And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick and
burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime for
mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven.”

Any mountain whose summit was high enough, such as Sinai or
Olympus, might thus furnish a convenient place for the fixed abode of
the gods, where they might build their homes and have some of the
comforts of family life. — 

κῆρ: 1014. It was not thought improper for
gods to show anger (χωόμενος). “ And while the flesh was yet between
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against
the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.” —

βῆ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο (Ὀλύμποιο, 571) καρήνων: of course if the gods lived
in heaven, they must come down to earth in order to work their will

among the children of men, as a system of telepathy had not yet been
elaborated. “ And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower,
which the children of men builded. ... So Jehovah scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to
build the city.” Apollo is thought of as resting at his ease in his palace
on Mt. Olympus when he hears the prayer of the priest.

45.	τόξα: only one bow; the use of the plural visualizes its various
parts. — 

ὤμοισιν: 1009. — 

ἀμφηρεφέα has its final vowel long here,
although it should be short. The reason is unknown.

46.	ἔκλαγξαν: like πολυφλοίσβοιο (vs. 34) is an onomatopoetic word,
by the use of which we are made to hear the rattle of the arrows of the
god in his rage. — 

χωομένοιο is used substantively, <gloss>of him enraged</gloss>.

47.	αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος : 1111. — 

νυκτί: 1007. — 

ϜεϜοικώς.— 

αὐτοῦ is emphatic by position. It is none less than the mighty god himself who is now before us. 

νυκτὶ ἐοικώς: like unto night, both in swiftness of coming and in the awful gloom and dread which night brings to primitive peoples who have no adequate lighting facilities. This expression visualizes his appearance for the eye, as ἔκλαγξαν presents his coming to the ear.

139.	Translate:

1. Apollo heard the Achaeans as they prayed. 

2. The gods went down from the summits of Olympus.

145.	48. νεῶν = νηῶν, 572, 992. — 

μετὰ . , . ἔηκεν : 1049. — 

ἰόν: the first arrow. The poet thus makes definite and clear the picture he is
seeking to paint.

49.	δεινή : terrifying. — 

κλαγγή: onomatopoetic. We thus hear the
clang of the bow. The rhythm of the verse, especially toward the end,
helps in producing this effect. — 

βιοῖο: gen. of source, 987.

50.	πρῶτον : 780—781. — 

ἐπῴχετο [ἐπ-οίχομαι] 

ἀργούς : swift as a silvery
flash, a highly picturesque way of presenting the effect upon the eye
of the swift glancing motion of the feet of dogs as they run.

This passage gives accurately the ordinary course of such plagues,
where the poet, perhaps without realizing it, follows closely the results
of modern medical science, in establishing the fact that such pestilences
usually attack animals first, and from these the contagion would spread
among human beings. During this whole procedure the god must be
thought of as seated on some high point of vantage, perhaps a convenient
cloud, or a hill in the neighborhood. He is of course invisible to the
suffering Greeks, who perhaps have not as yet suspected the real cause
of their afflictions. The clang of his bow might easily be mistaken for
thunder. To us moderns it seems rather undignified, not to say bathos,
to see the god so highly wrought up in his anger, coming down from
Olympus with all the attributes of terror, ready to visit destruction upon
the Greeks for their insult (through Agamemnon) to his priest, seat
himself and turn his implements of death upon the mules and dogs of
the camp, who had done him no wrong. This seems to be due to the
fusion of two conceptions: 1) the poetic description of the wrath of the
revengeful god, preparing to destroy those who have insulted his priest,
and 2) the actual description of the usual course of a plague.

51.	αὐτοῖσι: 1004, the men (their masters), as contrasted with the
animals, 1041, 6. — 

βέλος σεχεπευκές  originally, 1167, 2 (1168) ; 603-604;
619. — 

αὐτοῖσι refers of course to the Greeks, and brings them into sharp
prominence. “ The plague did not stop with the animals, but even
attacked their masters.”

<pb n="55"/>

52.	βάλλ’ is emphatic by position, by the following pause, by the prolonged
sound of the trilled λλ (making it onomatopoetic), and by meaning
(imperfect). The imperfect represents a series of repeated actions.
Observe how vividly the poet presents to the eye the great number of
deaths due to the arrows of the god. We can see the funeral pyres,
with their heaps of corpses, burning on every side.

On this whole passage, compare what Lessing says in the Laocoon,
when discussing some of the fundamental differences between the art of
the painter and that of the poet. “ The picture of the plague. What
do we see on the canvas? Dead bodies, the flame of funeral pyres, the
dying busied with the dead, the angry god upon a cloud discharging his
arrows. The profuse wealth of the picture becomes poverty in the poet.
Now let us turn to Homer himself. The poet here is as far beyond the
painter as life is better than a picture. Wrathful, with bow and quiver,
Apollo descends from the Olympian towers. I not only see him, but
hear him. At every step the arrows rattle on the shoulders of the angry
god. He enters among the host like the night. Now he seats himself
over against the ships, and with a terrible clang of the silver bow sends
his first shaft against the mules and dogs. Next he turns his poisoned
(deadly) darts upon the warriors themselves, and unceasing blaze on
every side the corpse-laden pyres. It is impossible to translate into any
other language the musical painting heard in the poet’s words.”

The stage is now all set for the introduction of the hero, the divine
Achilles, who henceforth plays a prominent part, and is never wholly
lost sight of for the rest of the poem.

146. Translate:

1. When the gods had come down from the summits of
Olympus, they seated themselves apart from the ships and
shot arrows among them, and a terrible clang arose from
their silver bows.

3. The bow of Apollo is of silver.

55.	τῷ: 997.

ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε Ἥρη: Achilles has an idea, which is
represented by the poet as an inspiration from heaven. Such was a
common belief regarding any plan which later developments showed to
be fraught with more than ordinary consequences, but this of course
could only be known after the events had transpired. “Now the city
was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses
were not builded. And my God put it into my heart to gather together
the nobles, and the rulers, and the people.” “And I arose in the night,
I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God
had put into my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast
with me, save the beast that I rode upon.” “And during supper, the
devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, to betray him. . . .”

It is just as well not to ask why Agamemnon, the leader of the forces,
who apparently was not yet aware of the cause of the plague, did not
summon this assembly. The poet explains it by saying that Hera was
responsible, and he thus frees Achilles from any blame in the matter.

Achilles is brought before us in a few verses as a chivalrous and generous-hearted
warrior, and is contrasted with the selfish, grasping, and
brutal Agamemnon. The poet does all this by indirection, with a very
few words, yet so skillfully that henceforth the sympathies of the
audience are with the hero.

λευκώλενος : the poet keenly senses the features of his objects which
are distinctive and characteristic, and which visualize them best for his
hearers. Thus when he says while-armed (λευκώλενος) Hera, one cannot


<pb n="58"/>

help seeing a beautiful and stately queen, with shining white arms.
In the same way, the ships are swift (vs. 12), and hollow (vs. 26),
Achilles swift-footed (vs. 58), Apollo a sharp-shooter (vss. 14, 21), and is a
god with a silver how (vs. 37), the Achaeans are well-greaved (vs. 17), the
ransoms shining (vs. 23), the sea loud-resounding (vs. 34), Leto flowing-haired
(vs. 36), the thigh-pieces of bulls and goats fat (vs. 40), Apollo’s
quiver covered at both ends (vs. 45), his bow silver (vs. 49, cf. vs. 37), his
arrows biting (vs. 51), and the dog's are swift as a silvery flash, (vs. 50).

56.	Δαναῶν : 984. — 

ὁράτο = ὡράετο, 584-585; 837 ; middle of interest, 1067, 2-3. Hera has a special affection for the Greeks: “ She kept seeing her own Danaans dying.” Observe the force of the imperfects: she had no opportunity to assuage her grief, because she had to keep watching her beloved Danaans perishing.

57.	ἤγερθεν = ἠγέρθησαν [ἀγείρω] : aor. passive ind., 3d plur., <gloss>they were
assembled</gloss>. This with the following phrase are good examples of epic
fullness of expression.

ἄμμε [ἐγώ] 971, acc. plur., <gloss>us</gloss>.

πάλιν παγχθέντας: i.e. without having captured

60-61. φύγοιμεν . . . δαμᾷ = δαμάει = δαμάσει [δαμάζω], 603-604 ; 584-585, 973, 2: by the use of the optative in the first clause and the future
indicative in the second, Achilles would imply that he felt it more probable
that they would all die there rather than escape.

62.	τινα [τὶς, τὶ] : acc. sing. masc. — 

μάντιν ἐρείομεν: when an insoluble
difficulty of any kind arose among uncivilized peoples, it was customary
to consult a specialist in theology, a priest, a prophet, or any one
to whom the lord had revealed his will directly or indirectly, as through
dreams. The true significance of dreams could be known only by those
to whom the god had given the faculty of interpreting them, as to
Joseph and to Daniel. Read 1 Sam. ix, 3-10, and 2 Kings 1, 2-3. —

ἐρείομεν = ἐρεύομεν = ἐρεύωμεν: 800, 1098. — 

ἢ καί: or even. — 

καὶ γάρ τ’ ὄναρ : for the dream also, as well as other signs and portents.

The abrupt action of Achilles in thus bluntly addressing his commander
in chief, and apparently without previous consultation with him,
practically demanding before all the common soldiers that the expedition
should be given up and that all should return home, is most remarkable
and is sure to be resented by Agamemnon. But then Hera is
to blame (read the note on vs. 55). Thus the poet gives good and
sufficient grounds for the righteous indignation of Agamemnon, and at
the same time prevents the sympathies of his audience from being
alienated from the hero.

Apollo, as god of health and disease, would be the first one thought
of in the present emergeney.

65. εὐχωλῆς, ἑκατόμβης : 979, 6 : on account of a vow (unfulfilled), or on
account of a hecatomb (unoffered). “ When thou shalt vow a vow unto
Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah thy
God will surely require it of thee ; and it would he sin in thee.” Cf. the
vow of Jacob, Gen. xxviii, 20-22, and of Jephthah, Judges xi, 30-39.
Achilles suggests some of the stock reasons why a god might be en-

raged. Apparently no one, apart from the seer, knew the real cause of
the god’s anger.

τελείων goes with both nouns.

67.	βούλεται: 800. —

ἡμῖν [ἐγώ] : dat. plur., 997. — 

ἀπὸ . . . ἀμῦναι 1048-1049.

66-67. The doubtful tone here shows that Achilles does not feel at
all certain that they will be successful in their appeal to the free-shooter.
Of course if the god has been offended, he must first be appeased before
he will listen to their prayer or accept their offering, “ for the sacrifice
of the wicked is an abomination unto Jehovah.” “ Hear, O earth:
behold I will bring evil upon this people . . . , because they have not
hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.” “ To what
purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane
from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your
sacrifices sweet unto me.” But if they once succeeded in allaying the
hot wrath of their god, the best way to win favor with him was to give
him a good dinner of nice roast lamb or kid. “ And he shall say, Where
are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted; who did eat the fat
of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?” “And
when thou preparest a bullock for the sacrifice, in performing a vow, or
peace offerings unto Jehovah: then shall he bring with a bullock a food
offering of three tenths of an ephah of flour, mingled with half an hin
of oil.” Of course the animals offered in sacrifice must be of the choicest,
fat and sleek, with no blemish or disease whatsoever.

Seeing that everything is going to ruin, Achilles suggests to Agamemnon,
commander in chief of the allied expedition, that they attempt
to save at least the lives of those remaining. The only way he sees of
doing this is to abandon the undertaking and return home. He suggests
further that they consult some holy man of God, who may tell
them what the trouble is and help them to avert the anger of the
divinity from those who are still alive.

It is characteristic of the psychology of primitive peoples to see in
the operations of nature the direct action of their gods, beings created
in their own image, with feelings and passions like unto their own. If
good fortune befell a people it was a mark of the special favor of their
divinity; if evil came it was a sign of his displeasure, and some one had
sinned, whom the god was seeking to punish. “ And Nathan said to
David, . . . Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of Jehovah,
to do evil in his sight ? . . . Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast
given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child
also that is born unto thee shall surely die. . . . And it came to pass

<pb n="64"/>

on the seventh day, that the child died.” “ Then there was a famine in
the days of David, three years, year after year; and David inquired of
Jehovah. And Jehovah answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody
house, because he slew the Gibeonites.” “ But the men of Sodom were
wicked and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly. . . . Then Jehovah
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from
Jehovah out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain,
and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
ground.” “ So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
men: and they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai smote of
them about thirty and six men : for they chased them from before the
gate even unto Shebarim. . . . And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to
the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah. . , . And Jehovah
said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which
I commanded them : for they have taken even of the accursed thing. . . .
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies,
but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed.
Neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed
from among you.”

68.	κατ’ . . . ἕζετο: 1049.

68-69. Although not called upon by name, Calchas here comes
dramatically forward, not from any egotism, but from a proper self-evaluation.
Homer’s heroes seem to have had little of that mock
modesty, humility, and self-depreciation in vogue to-day, which as
found in our own modern life seems to be primarily of Semitic ancestry.
“ And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto Jehovah, which am but dust and ashes.” “ How then
can man be just with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a
woman? Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are
not pure in his sight: how much less man, that is a worm! and the son
of man which is a worm! ” “ But I am a worm, and no man; a
 reproach of men, and despised of the people.”

69.	οἰωνοπόλων: birds, especially high-flying ones, which went up to
heaven, might reasonably be expected to become acquainted at times
with the will of the gods. This knowledge could be gained by mortals
who knew how to interpret their movements and cries, or who had
learned their language, as in Hebrew legend Solomon is reputed to
have done. “And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the
children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. Por he was wiser
than all men. And he spake with trees, from the cedar that is in

<pb n="65"/>

Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
also with beasts and birds and creeping things and with fishes.”

168.	Translate:

1. Calchas, son of Thestor, is the seer who may tell the Danaans why Phoebus Apollo is so greatly enraged.

2. Did Apollo blame the Achaeans on account of a vow, or on account of a goodly hecatomb of unblemished lambs and goats ?	

3. Apollo the free-shooter did not wish to partake of the fat of unblemished lambs and goats, but he warded off evil destruction for the Danaans. 

4. When the swift-footed Achilles had spoken thus he sat down, and the good(ly) seer, Calchas, son of Thestor, arose and spoke among the Achaeans in the assembly. 

5. May Calchas, son of Thestor, far the best of seers, speak the will of Zeus.

169.	Optional. At this point a thorough review of all the
preceding Homer should be taken; all the paradigms of all the
nouns should be memorized ; the irregular adjectives should now
he learned, and a review taken of all the others; and the verb
λύω in all its forms, including infinitives and participles, should
he mastered before attempting to read further. A good plan to
fix both forms and vocabulary is to take each word of the Iliad
as it appears in the text, locate the form, and give the meaning
of the word according to the model found in the vocabulary at
the end of this book. This should be done orally for these
verses, and this should be followed by a comprehensive written
examination. A good drill on these will materially lighten the
following work.

LESSON XXVIII: ADJECTIVES OF THE THIRD DECLENSION

Iliad, 70-75

170.	Only the masculine and neuter of these adjectives
have separate forms in the third declension. When the feminine
differs from the masculine, it is of the first declension.

of the third declension (725-732). The feminine of these
adjectives ending in -ᾰ is declined like θάλασσα sea, 663.

what is and shall be and was before, that is, he knew everything. Observe
how the characters of epic surpass all ordinary mortals. To forward the
action and bring about such far-reaching results, we must have the best
seer (οἰωνοπόλων ὄχ' ἄριστος, vs. 69) the world can afford. Read again
the note to vs. 15, § 90.

72.	ἥν [ὅs, ἥ, ὅν] his own. —

οἱ [ἑο] 760. Such a difficult
undertaking as the guiding of the ships for so great a distance,
through strange seas, could only be accomplished by the direct assistance
of the god, just as the Israelites were guided by Jehovah in their long
and difficult journey to Palestine. A soothsayer regularly accompanied
all ancient military expeditions, to interpret the will of the gods, and to
guide the people aright. In many cases they doubtless had superior
knowledge, which would help to explain their hold on the masses.
“ Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” “ And there
arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew
face to face.” “ And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them,
... I have led you forty years in the wilderness.” “ Thou leddest thy
people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.” — 

μαντοσύνην, τὴν οἱ πόρε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων : that is, he was a prophet inspired of his god, an
idea which those of his class have never been at pains to controvert.

“Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet.” “The
word that Jehovah spake against Babylon and against the land of the
Chaldaeans by Jeremiah the prophet.” “ Thus saith Jehovah.”

73.	σφιν [ἑο] : 760.

74.	κέλεαι με: when Calchas says: “ you urge me to speak,” his statement
is only relatively true, but since he is fully conscious, as are Homer’s
hearers, that he is οἰωνοπόλων ὄχ' ἀριστος, there is nothing out of place
in his stepping forward. In fact this was the only proper course for him
to pursue, and was thought of as perfectly natural by all concerned.
Owing to later developments, Agamemnon would be perfectly justified
in suspecting a collusion between him and Achilles.

Observe the spondaic ending, which brings this verse, and particularly
the last word, into strong prominence, as being of more than ordinary
importance. This gives an air of solemnity and slow-measured speech
to the words of Calchas.

4. We do not know the will of all the gods who have Olympian homes. 

5. Calchas the seer, who was far the best of soothsayers, guided the ships of the Achaeans into Ilium by his gift of prophecy which the gods gave to him. 

6. Phoebus Apollo granted to many Achaeans the gift of prophecy. 

7. Since we are well disposed toward the Danaans, we addressed them and spoke among them.

πρόφρων: observe that the Greek uses the adjective
where the English idiom would ordinarily prefer the adverb. — 

ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσὶν: 1005. The prophet signifies his willingness to impart the desired
information, but knowing the truth will hurt, he requests a sworn
pledge and an assurance of protection. As he will have to indicate that
Agamemnon is guilty, and as all are well aware of the violent temperament
of the son of Atreus, he makes the legitimate demand that Achilles
will not merely stand and talk while the god’s holy prophet is being
roughly handled. Observe in vs. 76 the emphasis placed upon ἐγώ and σύ
(which are always emphatic when expressed, since they are contained in
the personal endings of the verb and are ordinarily omitted). “<emph>I</emph> am
willing to perform my duty, if you will see to <emph>yours</emph>.” — 

ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσίν : “ by word and deed.”

ὀΐω Κάλχαντα χολώσειν ἄνδρα, ὃς μέγα κρατέει πάντων Ἀργείων. 

μέγα : 780-781.
Some see in the wavering meter of this verse an indication of an attempt
to portray the wavering of the mind of the soothsayer in his fear of
Agamemnon.

79. Ἀργείων (another name for the Greeks before Troy), 985. — 

οἱ  can be only the dat. of ἑο, 760, since it is an enclitic (as can be seen from the
accent of καί, 550, and formerly had Ϝ before it (Ϝοι) as is seen from the
meter, 1173,1175. It is a dative with a special verb, 996. Calchas gives
it as his opinion that what he has to say will enrage Agamemnon, whom
he does not mention by name, however, but describes so accurately that
no one could be in the least doubt as to whom he means.

80. κρείσσων (ἐστίν) βασιλεύς: that is, when a king and a man of the
common people become at odds, the king is the mightier, and naturally
will punish the ordinary man for his presumption. —

184.	Translate:

εἴ περ γάρ τε for even if.

82.	τε καὶ also. — 

ὄφρα τελέσσῃ (parenthetical):
i.e., till he obtains his revenge.

81-82. χόλος, κότος : the first of hot resentment,
which may pass, the second of a deep-seated
grudge, which calculates upon revenge.

83. ἐν στήθεσσιν ἑοῖσι : the possessive pronoun
is emphatic, to indicate that he keeps it absolutely
secret and bides his time for revenge.

φράσαι: imperative.

It has always been dangerous to arouse the
wrath of a king or of a god; for even though
they did not exact vengeance immediately they
would hold the grudge, sometimes even to the
third and fourth generation of the children of
the sinner, till they had obtained full satisfaction.
Then, too, when once their wrath was
kindled, they were notoriously and recklessly
cruel in revenging themselves. “ The wrath of
a king is as messengers of death, but a wise
man will pacify it.” “ The king’s wrath is as
the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew
upon the grass.” “Kiss the son (i.e. the king),
lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled
but a little.” “And when the people complained it displeased Jehovah:

and Jehovah heard it: and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of Jehovah
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost
parts of the camp.”

The seer really had more power than Agamemnon, who is compelled
to yield to him, as we learn in the sequel; but he does not wish to
expose himself unnecessarily either to any rashness on the part of the
king in his hot wrath nor to his plotting afterward, should he cherish a
grudge.

197.	86. οὐ μὰ γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνα (ὄμνῡμι) : this is the answer of
Achilles to the demand of Calchas that he swear, (ὄμοσσον, vs. 76) to protect
him. He meets the issue fairly and promises frankly. — 

ᾦ τε [ὅς τε, ἥ τε, ὅ τε].

<pb n="75"/>

87. Prayer was one of the means by which a prophet could learn the
will of his God. “And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. And Jehovah
said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people.” “ The prayer
of a righteous man availeth much.” — 86—87. 

ᾧ τε. . . ἀναφαίνεις parenthetic.

88: 994. There is of course the definite promise here that Achilles
is willing to defend the safety of Calchas, even with his own life, if need
be. The οὐ of this verse repeats the οὐ of vs. 86, for the sake of clearness
after the long intervening parenthetic clause. This verse is another
good example of epic fullness of expression, a form of pleonasm, used to
make the statement more emphatic aud impressive.

89.	σοί: 1004. Merely a picturesque way of saying that no one shall
strike the seer.

90.	Achilles is specific in naming Agamemnon, where the more prudent
and cautious Calchas had been content to use general terms in
describing him, without taking the risk of calling him by name.

91.	This is of course not egotism on the part of Agamemnon (cf.
note on vs. 68 ff.), but merely a naive recognition of his own worth.
He was not without a certain amount of competition in this matter,
however, as Achilles modestly claims this honor (of being ἄριστος
Ἀχαιῶν) for himself (vs. 224) ; and, for the purposes of the poet, various
leaders of the Greeks might on differing occasions be considered worthy
to bear this title. It is part of the superlative and hyperbolic language
of epic, cf. the note to vs. 15, § 90, and to vs. 70, § 176.

With these words Achilles takes the final step which must provoke
Agamemnon beyoud all measure. Carried away by his own generous
enthusiasm in protecting the defenseless, he sets himself up as the equal
of his commander in chief, and thus leads inevitably onward to the
bitter quarrel which ensues.

Achilles swears by the patron god of Calchas himself that no harm
shall befall the prophet, and that he is willing to risk his own life in
his defense, even though he accuse Agamemnon, whose violent and
reckless wrath was a matter of common knowledge. Such a promise
was naturally to be expected from Achilles’ impetuously generous character.
With this assurance the prophet is ready to disclose the will of
the god and the cause of all their woe.

It was once a matter of common belief that if any one swore by a
god and then proved false to his oath, the divinity involved would punish
him with all due severity. For that reason an oath was considered
as binding by those who would have no hesitation in breaking their
word. There is a peculiar fitness in swearing by Apollo here, not only

<pb n="76"/>

as the patron god of Calchas, but he is destroying the Greeks with his
arrows, and Achilles would be inviting a special dispensation of his
wrath npon himself should he fail to keep his vow. “ And ye shall not
swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God:
I am Jehovah.” “ If a man vow a vow unto Jehovah, or swear an oath
to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.” “ Thou shalt fear
Jehovah thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.” “ Thou
shalt not swear falsely by the name of Jehovah thy God; for Jehovah
will not hold him guiltless that sweareth falsely by his name.” “ Jehovah
hath sworn and will not repent.”

When Agamemnon claims to be “ far the best of the Achaeans,” he
uses “ best ” in the Irish sense, of being able to overcome any one there
in a fair fight.

92. θάρσησε: took courage: inceptive aorist, 1081. — 

ηὖδα = ηὔδαε [αὐδάω], 584-585. The seer, realizing that Achilles is the type of man
“ that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not,” is emboldened to
speak out unambiguously.

204. 93. εὐχωλῆς, ἑκατόμβης : 979, 6.

94. ἀρητῆρος: emphatic by position, and placed in strict contrast
with εὐχωλῆς, as both occupy the same position in the verse. “ Perhaps
you thought it was a vow or a hecatomb, but no, it was a priest.” Observe
how the seer waits till the last possible moment in his sentence
before speaking the name of Agamemnon, which might seem to indicate
his fear of him, but at the same time would bring this word into special
prominence.

94-95. The prophet first makes the general statement that the priest
was insulted, and follows this by citing two specific features.

96.	τούνεκ’(α) sums up the preceding and brings it out prominently,
so that there can be no mistaking what the real cause of the trouble is.

It has always been dangerous to insult a holy man of God. “ And
Elisha went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked
him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and
tare in pieces forty and two children of them.”

97.	Δαναοῖσιν: 997.—

ὅ γε resumes the subject, Apollo, with emphasis.
96-97 : perhaps the rhyme at the end of these two verses is intentional,
to bring these two words into full relief and sharp contrast with
each other.

98.	The subject of δόμεναι may be the Greeks, but more likely it is
intended to refer to Agamemnon, and would thus be omitted on purpose
by the priest, who is afraid of his anger, in spite of the assurance of
Achilles. — 

ἑλικώπιδα: “ bright-eyes,” is another of those speaking epithets
which brings the object vividly before the mind, and helps to
explain Agamemnon’s infatuation for the girl with her flashing eyes,
that sparkled with the fullness of rippling laughter.

97-98. πρὶν . . . πρίν: he will not sooner drive off pestilence . . . till
(we) give back .... — 

ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον: “ without money and without
price.” Tautology for the sake of emphasis. Restoration and

<pb n="79"/>

reparation must be made before the god will consider any peace
terms.

100. ἐς Χρύσην: into Chrysa, the town, not to Chryses, the priest.
Calchas is evidently not willing to guarantee that they will succeed in
appeasing the god by following his prescription, as the action of the
divinity is dependent upon his own arbitrary free will, and hence uncertain.
This type of statement has the further advantage of leaving a
loophole of escape for the priest, who would thus preserve inviolate his
reputation for infallibility. Theoretically it should be possible to persuade
the god, as Homer says in another place (where an old friend of
Achilles is trying to induce him to forego his anger against Agamemnon): “ Therefore, Achilles, rule thy high spirit; neither doth it befit
thee to have a ruthless heart. Nay, even the very gods can bend, and
theirs withal is loftier majesty and honor and might. Their hearts by
incense and reverent vows and drink-offerings and burnt offerings men
turn with prayer, so oft as any transgresseth and doeth sin.”.—

πεπίθοιμεν: 1105.

This speech of Calchas is a fine example of good oratory. First, he
disabuses the minds of his hearers of their prepossessions (they thought
the god might be offended because of some vow unfulfilled, or of some
hecatomb unoffered), and after thus clearing the way and having his
audience ask of themselves what then was the trouble with the freeshooter,
he gives the real reason, which strikes home and carries so
much conviction with it that Agamemnon, in spite of his angry opposition,
is compelled to bow, and to acknowledge that it is the finger of
god which forces him to yield his prize.

205. Translate:

1. Do the gods blame the Achaeans on account of a vow, or of a hecatomb, or on account of Chryses the priest, whom Agamemnon dishonored ?	

2. If Agamemnon will not release the dear daughter of the aged priest and receive the shining ransoms, the free-shooter will still give many woes to the Danaans, nor will he ward off unseemly destruction for them until they give back to her own father the white-armed maiden, unbought, and unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb into Chrysa ; then perhaps they may appease the god and persuade his soul.

103 f. The diaphragm was thought of as the seat of the emotions and
evil passions, just as the word “heart” is still used in English. “For
out of the heart proceed evil thoughts.” The dark cloud first gathers
in Agamemnon’s breast, before bursting in full fury upon Calchas. This
scene demonstrates that the seer well knew what he was about (ὃς ᾔδη
τὰ τ’ ἐόντα, etc., vs. 70) when he demanded protection of Achilles before
making his accusation of the king.

105.	πρώτιστα : 780—781. — 

κάκ’: 780-781, 1012. — 

κάκ’ ὀσσόμενος :
“with evil look” (literally “looking evil things”), i.e. a look that
boded trouble for Calchas. —

πρώτιστα: a double superlative, as “most
unkindest, most highest, chiefest,” etc.

This description of the wrathful Agamemnon, with eyes flashing fire
and foreboding evil, could be applied with exceptional fitness and without
any change to an angry lion, ready to spring upon the object of its
rage, which picture was perhaps more or less actively present in the
poet’s consciousness when he composed this passage.

106. τὸ κρήγυον Ϝεῖπας is unmetrical. Perhaps τὰ κρήγυα Ϝεῖπας stood
here originally. — 

εἶπας: 865, 3. “ I hate him, for he doth not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil.” Many see in this and the following

verses a reference to the events at Aulis, where in accordance with the
commands of Calchas Agamemnon was compelled to sacrifice his own
daughter, Iphigeneia, before the gods would send suitable winds for the
Greek fleet to set sail for Troy.

107. τοι echoes the μοι of the preceding verse, with which it is contrasted.
— 

τὰ κάκ’ ἐστί: 973, 1.

106-108. Agamemnon’s fury is aroused as he thinks he detects a plot
(of which Calchas and Achilles are the ringleaders) to rob him of his
prize. Apparently he has slight heed for priests and prophets and holy
men. His whole attitude toward the seer is one of burning scorn and
bitter sarcasm. Although he does not use the word, he forcibly suggests
that Calchas is a liar. “ Should thy lies make men hold their peace?”
“ Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination
? ” Besides, the gods could be dishonest at times. Thus Zeus sends
a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, and Jehovah might send a lying
spirit to deceive the prophets. It may be that the poet would represent
here a phase of the age-long struggle between rationalism (Agamemnon)
and religion (Calchas). 106-108 are merely the ordinary exaggeration
common to the heat of passion.

212.	Translate:

1. When we had spoken thus we sat down; thereupon the hero, swift-footed Achilles, arose and spake among the Achaeans.

THE APHRODITE OF MELOS

Louvre, Paris

More commonly known as the "Venus of Milo.” The statue was discovered
in 1820 a.d. on the island of Melos. It consists of two principal
pieces, joined together across the folds of the drapery. Most art critics date
this work about 100 b.c. The strong, serene figure of the god dees sets forth
the Greek ideal of female loveliness.

109. In vss. 106 ff. Agamemnon makes sweeping general charges
against Calchas; in vs. 109 he proceeds to the particular, καὶ νῦν, as proof
of his assertions.

110.	ὡς: 1154, 1. The whole attitude of Agamemnon toward Calchas
is one of sneering disbelief.

111.	ἐγώ: emphatic, since Calchas had claimed that it was Agamemnon,
and no other, who was to blame for the plague. Naturally Agamemnon makes out as good a case as possible for himself, and mentions
only the rejection of the ransoms, and has nothing to say of the insults
which he had heaped upon the old priest, and the affront he had shown
to the god. — 

κούρης: 979, 5.

112.	αὐτήν: the girl’s own self, as contrasted with the ransom. —
βούλομαι: prefer. — 

πολύ : 780-781.

113.	ῥα Κλυταιμ(v)ήστρης: 524, 988. The correct spelling of this
name is Κλυταιμήστρη, although practically all modern texts have Κλυταιμνήστρη, and we ordinarily have “ Clytaemnestra ” in English.

114.	ἑθέν [ἕο] : 993. When Chryseis is said to be no worse than Clytaem(n)estra,
it is only another way of saying that she is much more
preferable.

115.	δέμας, φυήν, φρένας, ἔργα (Ϝέργα) : 1014. — 

τι: 780-781.

After sneering at Calchas, Agamemnon hastens to add his own defense
for not accepting the ransoms and releasing the girl. He is careful
however not to mention his own brutal speech to the priest. Evidently
he is in love with Chryseis, who is much younger than his own wife
whom he had married in the days of his youth (κουριδίης), a situation
of the sort which has produced many of the world’s most interesting

<pb n="85"/>

tragedies. Apparently he would be more than willing to get rid of
Clytaem(n)estra and marry the girl. Unfortunately we are left entirely
in the dark as to how this was to be done. It would be interesting to
know whether Agamemnon has in mind some practical means of disposing
of Clytaem(n)estra, as by divorce, or whether this is merely a vision
of an unrealizable happiness, and he can only live on in the vague hope
that perhaps she may die first. Perhaps it is only another example of
“Maggie, my wife at fifty, grey and dour and old, with never another
Maggie to be purchased for love or gold.” <note>https://books.google.de/books?id=bbaJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT4217&amp;lpg=PT4217&amp;</note> By a tragic sort of ironical
poetic justice, Clytaem(n)estra settled accounts with Agamemnon upon
his return home, by murdering him, having proved as unfaithful to him
as he had been to her in his absence. This would of course be brought
vividly to the minds of Homer’s hearers when Agamemnon here mentions
her name.

115 ff. Instead of dealing in generalities, Agamemnon specifies the
qualities which make Chryseis seem lovely and desirable in his eyes.
By δέμας he refers to her stately build. The old Greeks never seem to
have found the petite particularly adorable, and they especially admired
women of large and imposing stature. By φνήν he refers to grace of
form and feature, and φρένας probably means that she was of an affectionate
disposition, implying a marked contrast in this respect with his
own Clytaem(n)estra. In other words, “Maggie is pretty to look at,
Maggie’s a loving lass.” And then, to crown all, he refers to ἔργα, her
accomplishments. These were not of the highly impractical sort sometimes
found in modern times, but the ἔργα of this young lady, which
found such a responsive chord in Agamemnon’s soul, were housewifely
accomplishments. She was doubtless a good cook (“For beauty won’t
help if vittles is cold, and Love ain’t enough for a soldier”), could spin
and weave, kept his soldier hut neat and clean, and saw to it that his
clothes were kept properly mended.

116.	καί: even. — 

εἰ τό γ’ ἄμεινον (ἐστιν) : Agamemnon still would
intimate that it is not for the best, and takes advantage of this opportunity
for another innuendo at the honesty of the seer.

117.	ἤ : rather than.

Seeing that he has to give her up, Agamemnon makes the best of the
situation, and by the addition of the last two verses (116-117) effectively
wins over the common soldiery to his side, an important consideration
in subsequent developments. This is a good speech and well worked
out in every way.

The ἐγώ of vs. 117 echoes the ἐγώ of vs. 11, and effectively refutes
the accusation there made.

3. Agamemnon wished to have her at home, since he greatly preferred her to Clytaem(n)estra his lawful wife.

Iliad, 118-125



225.	118. ἐμοί: 997. It is this unreasonable demand, which Achilles

on behalf of the people feels called upon to oppose, that provokes the
fatal quarrel.

119.	“Even if I should not demand a γέρας as justly due to me in
return for my giving back mine, common decency would require that
the king should have one, and thus not be lacking in this matter of
honor, while all the other chieftains have prizes.” The possession of
the γέρας was looked upon as a mark of honor due to royal station;

<pb n="88"/>

to give one was to honor the king and exalt his station; to take it away
without due recompense was felt as a keen disgrace. This the army
must prevent by giving him an equivalent for the prize he is about
to surrender. Thus Agamemnon’s demand is prompted by his feeling
of wounded honor, and by his inherent sense of the prerogatives due to
his exalted station, and not by avarice as Achilles thinks (vs. 122).
The injustice in his claim consists in his demand for immediate
(αὐτίκα) recompense, which Achilles clearly shows to be impracticable,
without committing an injustice to the others. But Achilles unfortunately
goes entirely too far in insulting the king and accusing him of
avarice beyond all other men.

120.	ὅ = ὅτι: that.—

μοι: dat. of interest, or possibly of disadvantage, 997-998.

121.	Achilles, who has summoned the assembly and who has promised
protection to Calchas, is the logical candidate to answer Agamemnon,
and doubtless all eyes were turned in his direction as Agamemnon finished
his harangne. The manner in which he makes his reply confirms the
suspicions of Agamemnon that he too is plotting to rob him of his
prize, and he thus draws upon himself the bolt which was ready to fall
apparently anywhere.

122. Achilles is so excited by the demand of Agamemnon that he
forgets his manners and does not show proper deference to his
commander-in-chief.

123	is a rhetorical question, and is employed as a device for stating as
strongly as possible that the great-hearted Achaeans cannot be expected
to give a prize. The two following verses explain why this is true.
The form of this question would imply that Agamemnon’s request is
absurd.

124	: litotes, with a touch of the sarcastic in πολλά. — 

τί: 780-781. —
ξῡνήια : used substantively, 1027, common stores.

125. τά, τά: the first of these should be translated as a relative, the
second as a demonstrative used substantively: Whatsoever we look as
plunder . . . these have been divided. — 

δέδασται: this tense would
indicate that the matter is settled, and not to be reconsidered. The
Greeks had already captured and plundered many cities of the Troad,
but had not yet been able to take Troy. This verse would indicate that
they had already met with considerable successes, and that a goodly
amount of spoil had been taken and distributed among the soldiers.
This booty formed the chief inducement to the Greek warrior for engaging
upon such enterprises. In sacking the captured cities, the male
inhabitants were usually put to the sword, while the females were made

<pb n="89"/>

slaves and distributed to the army as prizes. “ And they warred against
the Midianites, as Jehovah had commanded Moses; and they slew all
the males. . . . And the children of Israel took all the women of
Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their
cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. And they burnt all
their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles with
fire.”

“ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and Jehovah
thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou hast taken them
captive, and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; then thou
shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head and
pare her nails.” “ When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against
it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it shall be if it make thee answer
of peace and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that is
found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee,
then thou shalt besiege it: and when Jehovah thy God hath delivered it
into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of
the sword: but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself
; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy
God hath given thee.”

3. Thereupon all the Achaeans answered the swift-footed, god-like Achilles. 

4. The son of Atreus was the most glorious, but the most avaricious of all men, for he was not willing to give his own prize of honor back to her beloved father, because he did not see many common (stores) lying about, and what the great-souled Achaeans had sacked from the cities had been divided.

228.	Some verbs are formed the same as regular verbs in
-μι in the present and first aorist systems, but are more
or less irregular in certain respects. Some of these do not
have the second aorist. So far as they have other forms
they follow the analogy of λύω.

229.	Certain verbs have second perfects and pluperfects
without the tense suffix, the same as verbs in -μι. Their
personal endings are added directly to the verb stem.

230.	In this class belongs the regular verb οἶδa (2d perf.
of *εἴδω, with pres, meaning) know, which is not reduplicated.
The pluperfect (with imperfect meaning) is ᾔδεα
knew.

126. λᾱούς: 971. In demanding a prize immediately (vs. 118),
Agamemnon asserts that it is not fitting (vs. 119) that one of his rank
should be the only one to suffer from lack. Achilles retorts that it is
not fitting either (observe the force
of ἐπί in ἐπέοικε) for the people to
give up all their prizes (ἔοικεν thus
being echoed by ἐπέοικε).

127.	πρόες [προίημι] : Achilles attempts
to adopt a conciliatory tone,
but the angry Agamemnon is in no
mood to listen. Even though he is
offered a return of three or four hundred
per cent on his investment by
Achilles, speaking for all the Achaeans,
this is made contingent upon
the fall of Troy, which is not at all
sure, and might be at a very indefinite
future date. The appeal to
give up the girl to the god, who,
according to traditional religious
teaching, might be expected to add
some sort of reward of his own (“ and
everyone that hath forsaken houses,

trumpets. And it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast

heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great
shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into
the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.” “ And
Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah God of Israel. . . .
And ye went over Jordan and came unto Jericho: and the men of
Jericho fought against you. . . . And I delivered them into your hand.”

πόλιν : object of ἐξαλαπάξαι.

131.	δὴ οὕτως: synizesis, 586. — 

ἀγαθός περ ἐών (concessive): although you are brave.

132.	νόῳ : 1009. —

παρελεύσεαι  is a figure taken from the race course :
you shall not pass (me). Agamemnon begins his speech as did Achilles
(vs. 122) by addressing his opponent with a highly honorable title,
which is immediately followed by an abusive term. The fight is on,
and there is no turning back now. — 

κλέπτε νόῳ, to Agamemnon any
one who had the presumption to oppose the will of the mighty king of
men must be a scoundrel; and as Calchas was a liar (vs. 108, etc.), so
Achilles is a thief at heart. This accusation would be a grave insult to
the free and frank Achilles. On another occasion, when referring by
innuendo to Agamemnon, he says, “ For hateful to me even as the gates
of hell is he that hideth one thing in his heart and uttereth another.”
Agamemnon feels sure that Achilles is trying to steal his prize from
him secretly, by having him give her up without bestowing another
upon him. He is not satisfied with a vague promise of future recompense,
contingent upon an uncertainty, the sack of Troy. Achilles
speaks what is right and true; on the other hand, the claims of Agamemnon
are not without justice. Thus the poet with surpassing art
attributes to each the words and sentiments from which it was impossible
for the quarrel to be avoided.

such a plan in mind. The answer of Agamemnon to the charge of covetousness
by Achilles, is that Achilles is the one who has a selfish end in
view, and that he wishes further to disgrace the commander-in-chief in
the eyes of the army by talcing away his prize of honor, while he keeps
his own. — 

αὐτός : yourself, as contrasted with me and my situation.

135. Agamemnon repeats the words of Achilles in verse 123, to indi-

<pb n="96"/>

cate his readiness to accept that plan, but with his own conditions, not
those of Achilles, and it must be done now.

136.	This is perhaps pure subterfuge. Agamemnon may not be considering
the possibility he mentions here, but may have caught an evil
inspiration to rob Achilles of his prize, and so when he assails him by
demanding μη κλέπτε νόῳ (vss. 131-132), he may be employing a device
known the world around, of accusing his enemy of a crime which he is
contemplating himself. Probably Agamemnon makes a gesture at the
end of this verse, which would make the aposiopesis less violent.

137. ἕλωμαι: 1146. ἐγώ and αὐτός are added with a proud feeling of
conscious superior power.

138.	Observe how the addition of ἰών makes the picture definite and
adds a touch of the dramatic.

137-139. This is all more subterfuge. Agamemnon has not the
slightest intention of disturbing his two good and powerful friends,
Ajax and Odysseus, in their vested rights, but the whole passage
is aimed at Achilles. Agamemnon here mentions these two mighty
chieftains to indicate his own superiority. 139. “ I am inclined to think
that he (ὁ said with a meaning look at Achilles) may be enraged.” This
is a good example of the grimly humoresque in which Homer’s heroes
sometimes indulge. Agamemnon gloats over his ability to do as he
pleases, without having to worry over the consequences. — 

ἵκωμαι: 1146.

141. Considering the case closed, the king calls for immediate action,
to carry out his plans as outlined. — 

μέλαιναν indicates that Homer spoke
for the eyes as well as for the ears of his audience. From the time of
“Noah’s ark” vessels were calked by a treatment of pitch, to make the
seams water-tight. This gave them the black appearance which the
poet uses to visualize them for his hearers. —

146-147. To rob Achilles of his prize, and at the same time to compel
him to become an active instrument in his own undoing, at the behest
of his deadliest and most hated enemy, is the height of ironical tragedy.
Probably Agamemnon does not really intend to do this, but is only making
another attempt at a bitter and cynical jest. — 

ἱλάσσεαι: 800, 1115-1116.	— 

ἱερὰ ῥέξᾱς: (by) performing sacrifices.

149.	The simple-hearted Achilles takes Agamemnon’s words to be in
earnest, and thinks that they indicate a fear on the part of the king to
attempt the seizure of his prize openly, but that he is planning to send
him away on the expedition while he is accomplishing this. So he calls
Agamemnon “ crafty-minded.” —

is perhaps referring primarily to himself, but the effect of this is to make
an indirect appeal to whatever there might be of latent rebellion among
the soldiery against such high-handed injustice.

Iliad, 152-157

257.	152. ἐγώ: emphatic (1039), as contrasted with Agamemnon
and his brother Menelaus, who had a strong personal interest in the
success of the expedition.

153.	μαχησόμενος : 1109, 5.—

τι: 780-781.

154.	βοῦς = βόας : throughout all history cattle have been an important
economic factor. Thus the English words “ fee, chattel, pecuniary,”
etc., indicate the part they have played in our own and in the Roman
monetary systems, as a medium of exchangee, before the introduction of
coinage. In Homer’s time maidens were called cattle-bringing, because
their suitors regularly gave cattle to their fathers as a wedding present,
in return for the girl as a wife. A useful woman in Homeric times
might be worth as much as four cows. Their great importance has
made them an object of divine worship among many peoples, as among
the old Hebrews, who for a long period of their history worshipped a
bull-god, of which the horns of the altar were a survival.

155.	βωτιανείρῃ: observe the touch of local pride, so common throughout
all nations. His home produces heroes, of which he is one. The
ornamental epithets and picturesque language may indicate how dear to
his heart his old home in Phthia was. Perhaps he is almost homesick.

157.
ἠχήεσσα: onomatopoetic, to represent the sound of the roaring
sea.—

σκιόεντα refers to the long shadows which high mountains throw.
This verse is in apposition with πολλά (used substantively) of the
preceding verse.

Observe the heaping up of the first personal pronouns in this passage,
to indicate that Achilles had no personal interest, as did Agamemnon,
in the expedition.<n>can we show that this is statistically significant? Note that we have egw and moi as well as emas -- different lemmas</n> Achilles emphasizes his own generous motives and
self-sacrificing spirit in joining the undertaking, thereby throwing into
high relief the ingratitude of Agamemnon and the deep injustice of his
selfishness. “ The Trojans have never done me the slightest harm, that

<pb n="102"/>

I should have gone to all this trouble in making this expedition against
them.”

154 ff. Such wanton robbery and destruction of property might he
either the occasion or the result of war. The origin of the Homeric
wars, as most wars before and since,
had ultimately an economic basis,
and they were waged either to protect
their own property or to gain
possession of that of their neighbors.

“And the children of Israel did that
which was evil in the sight of Jehovah
: and Jehovah delivered them
into the hand of Midian seven
years. . . . And so it was when
Israel had sown, that the Midianites
came up, and the Amalekites, and
the children of the East, even they came up against them; and they
encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou
comest to Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor
ox, nor ass.” “ And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and
the men of Jericho fought against you. . . ; and I delivered them into
your hand. . . . And I have given you a land for which ye did not
labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards
and olive trees which ye planted
not do ye eat. Now therefore fear Jehovah
and serve him.” “And Joshua did
unto them as Jehovah bade him: he
houghed their horses, and burnt their
chariots with fire. . . . And all the spoil
of these cities, and the cattle, the children
of Israel took for a prey unto themselves;
but every man they smote with the edge
of the sword, until they had destroyed
them, neither left they any to breathe.”

156-157. Achilles is not strictly logical; for in spite of the crashing sea that
rolled between, he was doing in Troy
the very thing which he says the Trojans
have never done in his land because of the intervening distance.—

πολλὰ (ἐστίν).

Achilles is now ready to renounce all allegiance to such a leader, who

which helps Achilles decide to stay.

Ironical, of course.

175. A reply to the assertion of Achilles in vs. 159. This is a good
example of the subtle irony of the poet; for it is Zeus and no other who
dishonors Agamemnon in the sequel. The king’s proud speech here and
his haughty presumption upon the favor of Zeus, the natural protector
of kings, thus make his later discomfiture all the more striking and humiliating.—

— σίθίν: 984. Observe the hissing effect produced by the heaping
up of sigmas in this and the preceding verse. Μνρμφάνζσσιν receives
prominence by its position in the verse, since Agamemnon wishes to
make clear to Achilles the limits of his authority, and that he has no
right to be issuing commands to the Achaeans. Agamemnon will bear
no infringement of his own prerogatives.

181.	KOTtovTos (rco) : 984.

In this whole passage Agamemnon assumes a tone of sneering sarcasm
and contempt for Achilles, as though he were but a peevish and willful
child. Thus he belittles Achilles’ every motive and excellence. His
threat to return home is interpreted as due to panicky fear, his bravery
in war, his impetuous spirit, and his strength of will, are all qualities
which make him a nuisance as a quarrelsome and contentious fellow.
“Pray don’t let me detain you,” he says, “if you are in such a hurry to
flee. It will be a blessing to see you gone, since you are so perverse and
given to strife. Be sure to take all your bags and baggage along, and
don’t be trying to strut around here with your authority, but run along
home to the Myrmidons, where you belong. Pout away all you please.
Your anger is the least of my worries. It is all the same to me whether
you hold a grudge or not, and just to show you how much I care, I shall
threaten you as follows: ” This all proves too much for Achilles, who
feels now that he cannot return home without provoking the ridicule of

upon staying.

The situation has now reached the point where Achilles feels constrained
to act, as he would rather die than endure such deep insults and
humiliation at the hands of his most despised enemy. The imperfects
in the first two verses make the description strikingly vivid and picturesque,
while the hurried action of the two following aorists are well
adapted to introduce Athena suddenly and dramatically. The appearance
of Athena is as unexpected, and is
introduced with as much dramatic effect
as the intervention of the angel when
Ahraham was getting ready to perform
the final act in the sacrifice of Isaac:

“ And Abraham stretched forth his hand,
and took the knife to slay his son. And
the angel of Jehovah called unto him out
of heaven, and said, Ahraham, Abraham:
and he said, Here am I. And he said,

Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither
do thou anything unto him.”

“ And the angel of Jehovah stood in the
way for an adversary against him. . . .

And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah,
standing in the way, and his sword
drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went
into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.”
The Homeric divinity never appears to a group, hut only to individuals.
Besides it would have spoiled the plot had Athena been seen or heard
by the other Greeks, including Agamemnon.

words. — όράτο = ώράίτο, 584-585, 837.

the words were personified, and if they flew from the mouth of the
speaker to the ears of the listener, they would need wings, just as birds.

202. αἰγιόχοιο: the aegis of Zeus was a shield, adorned with the head
of the Gorgon, a snaky-headed monster, which petrified with chilly fear
all who looked upon it. Athena was the best beloved of the children of
Zeus, since she had sprung, as goddess of wisdom, full grown and fully
armed from his head. As his favorite child she often bore his aegis.
Achilles seems displeased at Athena’s interf erence, and is greatly vexed
that he should be prevented from killing Agamemnon. — aSrt does not
of necessity refer to an earlier appearance of Athena, but may merely
denote Achilles’ impatience that one trouble after another seems to
have befallen him; and so he says, “And have you come too” (as an
addition to all my other vexations) ?

203.	Ιδη = ΐδηαι: 584-585. __ Achilles answers his own question (vs.

202) by a second rhetorical one. Hybris was something always to be
punished by the gods, “ for the froward is an abomination to Jehovah.”
If Athena wished to be sure as to Agamemnon’s hybris, the best way was
for her to come down and see for herself. “ And Jehovah said, Because
the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very
grievous; I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
know.”	%

206.	γλαοκώπνϊ: supplements vss. 199-200, and shows why Achilles so
quickly recognized the goddess. Originally it seems to have meant owleyed.
Its origin was lost sight of before the time of Homer, to whom
she was gleaming-eyed, flashing-eyed, etc., but it represents the earlier idea,
according to which the goddess was thought of in the form of an owl,
just as Jehovah was worshipped by the Israelites for a long time in the
form of a bull-god, as Apollo Smintheus was once the mouse-god, etc.

207.	ιταΰσουσα: 1109, 5. — ιτίθηαι: Athena is not quite sure that
Achilles will obey, but hopes so.

counsels a word-war, instead of a resort to arms, and thus there is a
reversion to the situation previous to Achilles’ attempt to draw his
sword. — is ϊσίταὶ irtp: “ tell him how it shall be,” i.e. “ tell him what
shall take place.” This deus ex machina scene, which is necessary for
the further action and development of the poem, would be an artistic
blemish in a work where the gods do not take such a prominent part
and do not consort so freely with mortals as they do in the Iliad.

216.	χρή (εστιν). — τφωίτ€ρον is made emphatic by the following ye,
whereby Achilles contrasts his attitude of respectful obedience toward

motivate the decision of Achilles to remain before Troy instead of his

Jehovah thy god, and shalt be obedient to his voice ; he will not forsake
thee, neither destroy thee.” “ As the nations which Jehovah destroyeth
before thy face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient
unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.” “ Now we know that God heareth
not sinners: but if a man reverence his God, and doeth his will, him he
heareth.” “He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him: he will
also hear their cry, and save them.” “Jehovah is far from the wicked :

returns to Olympus among the other divinities. In the same way it
would be hard to visualize the descent of Apollo (vs. 44 ff.) from the
peaks of Olympus to the Trojan plain, which was many miles away,
across the sea. See the note on vs. 592, 450.

gods give especial heed to (the prayer of) those who obey
them. 5. Upon their silver hilts they hold their heavy
hands, and thus disobey the commands of the two goddesses.

Without regard to truth or reason, Achilles heaps upon Agamemnon

Beginning with vs. 224, Achilles now feels free to answer Agamemnon
; and so he pours out his wrath, makes a prophecy of the future,
and sits down, while Agamemnon remains silent, possibly because 'he is
speechless from rage. Achilles employs no word of honor in his address
this time, but laj7s to with the most abusive epithets at his command.
In his anger, he is guilty of untruthful exaggeration in charging
Agamemnon with drunkenness, shamelessness, and cowardice. As a
matter of fact, Agamemnon was brave as a lion.

the life of the king,” “ by the beard of the prophet,” “ by my hope of
heaven,” etc. Thus Shakespere’s characters swear by their beards.
Achilles swears by the sceptre as a symbol of his royal power, with the
implication that he hopes to lose it if he swears falsely. Slightly different
is the implication when he swears by Apollo (vs. 86). See the note
there, 197. The gods swore by the river Styx. The gist of this whole
passage is “ as surely as this sceptre shall never sprout forth leaves and
branches again, so surely shall the Achaeans miss me, now that I shall

239. «Ιρναται: 3d plur. = tlpvvται, 597-598. — ό: masculine, where the
neuter would be expected. It takes the gender of the following predicate
(όρκο?), by what is known as “ attraction.” — irpos Διόβ: under
the supervision of Zeus, or else the laws from (i.e. given by) Zeus.
Most peoples have traditions of law's given them by their gods, as in the
case of Numa and the early laws of Rome. “And Jehovah said unto
Moses, Come up to me into the mount and be there, and I will give thee
tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written;
that thou mayest teach them.” “ These are the statutes and judgments
and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel
in Mount Sinai by the hand Of Moses.” The judges also received their
authority from on high and were the Lord’s own anointed.

321. Translate:

1. We shall declare and also swear a great oath. 2. By
this sceptre, ye shall not return safely home, but ye shall all
perish here. 3. Our sceptres will never produce leaves and
branches, nor will they sprout forth, since they have left their
stumps in the mountains. 4. The sons of the Achaeans
with bronze peeled the sceptres round about of their leaves
and branches, and now the kings, dispensers of justice, who
preserve the laws given to them by Zeus, bear them in their
hands.

Homer goes quietly on, here introducing a description which vivifies the

need not feel compelled to infer therefrom that every sceptre mentioned
by Homer as golden was merely studded with golden rivets, as the poet
does not feel obliged to be strongly and carefully consistent, but always
feels free to vary according to the necessity of the situation and the effect
he wished to produce. Thus the gods are at times strictly anthropomorphic,
with very human limitations, at other times they are thought of as

ethereal, omnipotent, and eternal, corresponding closely to the varied
conceptions of Jehovah in the Old Testament. — χρϋσeiois ήλοισι ireu-αρ-
pivov: this addition by way of description in the moment of greatest
suspense is characteristic of the objectivity of the poet’s art. He is so
little touched personally by the content of what he relates, that he makes
his way undisturbed through the strife of the kings without taking sides,
and in the midst of the greatest excitement he still has an eye for details.
He sees not only the wrath of the chieftains but also the golden heads
of the nails, driven into the sceptre as a crude sort of ornament. It may
be too that the poet wished to increase the
tension by keeping his audience in suspense
a moment longer, before telling them what
happened next.

247.	Nestor was famed for his old age,
and for giving long-winded advice, both in
and out of season, in which he dealt with
particular delight upon his own deeds of
wonderful achievement in the “good old
days.” He is the only one of the leaders
who has the hardihood to interfere in the
quarrel.

248.	άνόροικτ£=; ἀνώρουσε: perhaps slightly
undignified; but Nestor feels that he is the
man for the occasion, and that no time is to
be lost. He is in a hurry to show these
young upstarts how foolish and childish
their actions are. The mention of his oratorical ability would indicate
how highly prized oratory was among the ancient Greeks.

249.	τοΰ: rel. pron., referring to Nestor. — («)p££v: the imperfect
of customary or repeated action. — |u\iros: 993, honey was used by
the ancients in the place of sugar, and was the sweetest thing known to
the taste. Hence it was a favorite figure in comparisons where a high
degree of sweetness was involved. “ What is sweeter than honey ? and
what is stronger than a lion?” “The judgments of Jehovah are true
and righteous altogether. More to he desired are they than, gold, yea
than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.”
“My son, eat thou honey, because it is good ; and the honeycomb which
is sweet to the taste.” “How sweet are thy words to my taste! Yea,
sweeter than honey to my mouth! ” “ Thy lips, 0 my bride, drop as
the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue.” “ I have eaten
my honeycomb with my honey.”

HOMERIC GREEK

341.	250. τώ: 998. The figure of Nestor has become proverbial for
very old age. Reckoning a generation at about a third of a century, as
did the ancient Greeks, he -would be somewhere between seventy and a
hundred years of age. This is an imaginative touch of the poet, to
obtain a necessary character for a particular rSle, and does not require a
rational explanation^ He had lived long and experienced much, and
had no aversion to telling long stories of his earlier experiences, and to
offering all sorts of good advice, which was rarely acted upon. He is
one of the best drawn of Homer’s characters. Like old Polonius, he
was wordy and futile. Since brevity was the soul of wit, he would be
brief — with many words, and proffer his advice, in and out of season,
usually to the irritation of all concerned.

251.	ίφθίαθ’ = Ιφθίατο, 3d plur., = ίφθιντα, 597—598. — οϊ ol: the first
of these is the rel. pron., nom. plur. masc., referring to ανθρώπων, vs. 250 ;
the second is an enclitic (554, 760), as will be seen from the accent of
the first, and is spelled ‘pot, as may be observed from the meter. Here
it is the dative of accompaniment with ἀμα.— τράφεν ( = ίτράφησαν) ήδ«
■γίνοντο, hysteron proteron, i.e. the time represented by iyivovro comes
before that of τραφίν, although τράφίν here precedes lyevovro. This
is a permissible device, as it indicates priority of interest, instead of the
usual one of time. Compare Shakespere’s “I was bred and bom.”
The main idea is contained in the first expression, while the second is
added as an after-thought, for the sake of greater fullness and accuracy.

252.	τριτάτοκτιν is masc., referring to the general idea of men, as
implied in the word yeveai, vs. 250.

254.	Άχαιί8α yalav : 1019, i.e. “ our homes.”

254 ff. “ Tut, tut, my boys ! 1 The very idea of you two fighting like

schoolboys over marbles! She isn’t worth it. There are a million surplus
girls.”

of rejoicing to our enemies, since it would hinder the successful prosecution
of the war.

258.	βουλήν, μάχίο-θαι: acc. and infinitive of specification, 1014; the
two prime characteristics essential to a successful leader. — Δαναών:

taken with the verb Ιστὶ [εΐμ,ι], meaning surpass, he superior, 988.
Observe how judiciously the old man mingles praise with censure.

years in the eyes of Nestor was reason enough why every one should
heed his words.

were fond of representing their enemies as centaurs, and it is characteristic
of human psychology of all ages to term one’s enemies “ brutes,”
“ savage beasts,” and such choice epithets.

3	55. 269. τοΐο-ιν: 1006-1007, with such men as these, referring to
the Lapithae. ■—«γώ is emphatic (761), said with a proud self-consciousness,
and the effect is further heightened by the use of the middle
καλίσαντο in the next verse. — αΰτοί: “ they themselves, and no less personages,
great as they were, called me, even though I lived far away; for
they were willing to go to extra trouble to obtain the services of such a
good warrior, passing over many brave men who lived between.”

270.	καλί'σαντο: observe the force of the middle, “for their own
sake,” which denotes the special interest of the subject in the action,
1068, 1067, 3.

βροτοὶ tlcrtv: it is characteristic of tradition in less advanced stages of
civilization to feel sure that the world is growing worse, that men have
degenerated from a garden-of-Eden stage, when all the world was bright
and happy, when no man did wrong, sickness and sin and sorrows were
not, and the race of men was much better physically as well as morally
than succeeding generations. Since that time the world has continued
to decline till it has reached its present deplorable state. Such ideas
flourish actively in an uncritical and credulous age, when men are perfectly
willing to believe of a former period that “there were giants in
the earth in those days; the same became mighty men, which'were of
old men of renown.” Thus Homer feels convinced that the warriors
whose doughty deeds he sings were far superior to the race of mortals of
his own time. For example, he says “ with his hand the son of Tydeus
seized a stone, a mighty weight, which not even two men could carry,
such as mortals now are, but even alone he waved it easily.” And again
of Nestor’s cup he says “ another man with g'reat effort could have moved
it from the table when it was full, but Nestor, though an old man, raised

it with ease.” And again: “ Hector snatched up a stone and lifted it,
which not even two of the best men of the people, such as men now are,
could pry from the ground upon a wagon with crowbars, but he easily
brandished it alone.” Furthermore, Homer’s characters, and those of
epic in genera], are divine, or greater than ordinary mortals.

275-277. Observe how impartial and undiscriminating Nestor is, in
using exactly the same expression of prohibition in addressing the two
contestants (fir/re συ . . . pr/re συ). The first of these refers of course to
Agamemnon, the second to Achilles.

278. ἀντιβίην is emphatic by position. — τϊμ-rjs: 982.

278-279. Never has (any other) sceptre-hearing ling obtained honor equal
(to that of Agamemnon). That is, according to the Homeric tradition,
as placed in the mouth of Nestor, Agamemnon was the mightiest ruler
of his time; therefore Achilles should yield precedence to him. Nestor
emphasizes the divine right of Icings, who have obtained their authority
by grace of god, and as such are his representatives on earth. To oppose
one would be blasphemous; for they are the Lord’s own anointed.
“ And it came to pass afterward that David’s heart smote him because
he had cut off Saul’s skirt. And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid
that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord’s anointed, to
stretch forth my hand against him, seeing that he is the anointed of the
Lord.” “ David and Abishai came to the people by night; and behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster. Then said Abishai unto David, God hath delivered thine
enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore, let me smite him, I pray
thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him
a second time. And David said unto Abishai, Destroy him not; for
who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and be
guiltless ? ”

280.	it: concessive, even if.

281.	irkcovecrcriv: dat., with a verb of ruling. — οδ«: Agamemnon, of

282.	“Nay, it is 7, even Nestor, who entreat thee.” Nestor makes a

stressed by being placed at the end of the verse, and by being followed
by ye.

284.	Άχαιοϊσιν : 997, 999. — ιτολίμοιο : 979,3. Nestor employs a figurative
expression in speaking of Achilles, of a type common to many
languages; thus in the psalmist: “ Jehovah is my defence; and my god
is the rock of my refuge.”

286.	κατὰ μοίραν : fittingly.

287.	3S ἀνήρ is said by Agamemnon with supreme contempt, as he
does not even deign to mention the hated name of his opponent: “ this
fellow.”

Agamemnon apparently agrees with Nestor’s contention, but will admit
no fault of his own, throwing all the blame on Achilles. He insists
further that his overlordship be formally recognized by the rebellious
spirit of Achilles (see vss. 54, 59 ff., etc.), but Achilles refuses. Agamemnon
is not altogether without justice on his side, as Achilles has done
much to call his authority in question and has set a bad precedent in
case there should be difficulty in the future.

288.	πάντων : 985. — πάντ«ran.: 1001.

289.	fi: 1014. — τιν (α) : 971, perhaps refers to Agamemnon. If so,
it is superlatively ironical and sarcastic. If it merely means “ many a
one,” as often, it still has a considerable amount of the ironical element
in it.

356. NOTE: Iffurther practice in the translation of prose, either GreekEnglish
or English-Greek, is desired, the instructor may make out as much
of this as he wishes for his purposes. Most will find the foregoing more than
adequate for the work of the first, year.

in vs. 284.	\

290-291. A rhetorical question.—«fletrav, irpo6eovriv : a pun.

294. irav ίργον : 1013—1014.

296.	roi: 996. This verse is a sneering parody of vs. 289; some
scholars consider it spurious. — όίω: is ironical, as usual.

298.	χ«ρτί: 1005. — th : 760.

299.	tu [ris, τι 769]: Achilles is having a hard struggle with his
pride. He is afraid that some one will call him a coward if he yields to
Agamemnon’s demand that he recognize his authority, and so he finally
decides that he would rather give up the girl, even though he does love
her (see note to vs. 348) than yield to Agamemnon’s wishes. He has
now come to the point of open rebellion against the king, and flatly
refuses to take any further orders from him or to recognize his authority,
as Agamemnon had insisted.

et'vtKa κοΐρηβ is said with supreme contempt. “ I would not fight with
my hands on account of a girl.” Achilles attempts to conceal his real
feelings, as he sees that he has no way of successfully opposing the king
and his forces. Before closing, however, he makes it quite plain that he
holds all the Greeks responsible for the wrong done him, because they
have not the courage to oppose Agamemnoh’s arrogance, and thus through
him they are taking back the prize they once gave.

301.	τῶν resumes the των ἀλλων of vs. 300, with added emphasis. —
cUkovtos Ipcto : 1111.

302.	ΐΓίίρησαι is issued in the form of a challenge: “just try it!”
“ I dare you to try it.” In placing a higher value on liis other possessions
than on his prize, Achilles seems to have suffered an unexpected change
of heart, and whether it is a case of “ sour grapes ” or not, he seems suddenly
to have become converted to the idea that after all “a woman
is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.”

303.	δουρὶ (ίμω).

297-303. These words of Achilles come pretty close to the ridiculous,
and doubtless provoked loud hoots and jeers from Agamemnon’s partisans.
The whole quarrel had been about the girl; and Achilles by this
statement throws his cause completely overboard and brings up another
subject having nothing to do with the question. Agamemnon had never
remotely intimated that he was considering anything of this kind.

they had remained sitting, contrary to Homeric etiquette. When they

307.	Μίνοιπάδη : Patroclus. Like Agamemnon (vs. 7) Patroclus is
first introduced by his patronymic, because he was such a well-known
figure of the legend that it was not necessary to be more specific. He
and Achilles were fast friends, and he stood by Achilles through all this
period of trial. It is only his death in battle which furnishes a motive
sufficiently powerful to induce Achilles to take a further part in the
fighting. His introduction at this point is very skillfully done, as it is
clearly indicated where he stands in relation to the hero.

epithet of the wiliest of all the Greeks, and is particularly fitting here,

as it is necessary to choose a man with these qualities for such an important
embassy.

312. κίλΐυθα: 1012.

313-314. The whole army had been made unclean by Agamemnon’s
guilt, as had happened to the army of Joshua because of Achan : so they
must be purified. Physical cleanness, acquired by washing, symbolized
ritualistic purity, just as the rite of baptism typifies the washing away
of the sinner’s guilt. To a mind lacking in poetic and creative imagination,
it might occur that we have here a real hint as to the cause of such
a plague, in a lack of proper sanitary measures and of bodily cleanliness
on the part of the Greeks. After they had given themselves a good
scouring, the plague ceased. In the same way, many of the “ laws of
Moses,” with their ritual of purification, rested ultimately upon a dimly
discerned sanitary basis. “ He that toucheth the dead body of any man
shall be unclean seven days; the same shall purify himself ” (with water
and ashes).

326-327. Observe how closely these two verses echo and recall verses
25 ff., especially vs. 34, where Agamemnon dismisses the old priest so
harshly, to the woe of the Greeks. So here the hot temper of the king
is preparing further trouble for his followers. The ships of the Greeks
were drawn up in lines along the shore. Those of Odysseus were in the
centre, while the two ends, the most dangerous positions, were held by
Achilles and Ajax, as the most redoubtable warriors of the whole army,
for they trusted in their manhood and the strength of their arms The
assembly would be near the centre of the line by the ships of Odysseus.

329. τόν : there is no need to mention his name, as it is uppermost now
in the minds of all; and it is much more effective to say “ him they found,”

329-330. Achilles is apparently already brooding over his wrongs
and his plans for vengeance.

3	74. 834. Aios ayyikoi: officials in antiquity regularly obtained
their authority from on high, and were the earthly representatives of
divine power. As such they were to be respected and honored at all
times; “ for thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy
people.” “ And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it
is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.”

334-336. · Achilles, realizing the embarrassment, and even fear, of the
heralds, lest he might break out into open violence, hastens to set them
at ease and to let them know that they need not be afraid of him, for he
would not harm them.

337 ff. Achilles asks Patroclus to lead out the maiden and hand her
over to the heralds, evidently not having the heart to do it himself. As
we know from later developments, he had fallen in love with her.

εϊο-ytWs: Zeus-born. The kings of antiquity were regularly gods and
sons of gods. “Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my son; this
day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” Thus shortly before the introduction
of Christianity altars were set up in various parts of the Roman
empire upon which sacrifices were made to Augustus Caesar as a “ god
and the son of a god.”

378.	348. ἀκουσ’(α) is a delicate touch of the poet, showing that
Briseis returned Achilles’ affection, and that Achilles is angry not
merely because of wounded honor. This adds to the pathos of the
situation. Later Achilles himself says, “But why must the Argives

; make war on the Trojans? Why hath the sou of Atreus gathered his
host and led them thither? Is it not for lovely-haired Helen’s sake?
Do then the sons of Atreus alone of mortal men love their wives?
Surely whatsoever man is good and sound of mind loveth his own and
clierisheth her, even as I too loved mine with all my heart, though but
the captive of my spear. But uow that he hath taken my prize of
honor from my arms and hath deceived me, let him not tempt me that
know him full well; he shall not prevail.” It is this true affection
between Achilles and Briseis which makes the present situation so inexpressibly
bitter for him. Homer does not waste words in farewell
scenes, and here he sums up the feelings of Briseis in a single adjective.

349. δακρΐο-as, 1081: by this simple description the hearer was made

<pb n="154"/>LESSON LVIII

[378

his feelings. He “ burst into tears,” partly perhaps from grief, but even
more in hot and helpless anger at the insults that had been heaped
upon him. Homer’s heroes are highly emotional, and are not ashamed
to give full expression to their feelings. They are no more dainty about
the shedding of tears than they are over the shedding of blood. Later,
■when the battle has been going against the Greeks, Homer says of Agamemnon,
“ The son of Atreus was stricken to the heart with sore grief,
and went about bidding the clear-voiced heralds summon every man by
name to the assembly. ... So they sat sorrowful in assembly, and
Agamemnon stood up weeping like unto a fountain of dark water that
from a beetling cliff poureth down its black stream; even so with
deep groaning he spake among the Argives.”

350.	ίφ’ ( = ’em) : 1050, 1. — όρόων: an “ assimilated,” or “ distracted ”
form (= δράων), 915-948. It is eminently proper that Achilles should
be represented as looking out upon the deep; since the boundless sea
with its countless, never-resting waves, corresponds to the endless tumult
of his troubled soul.

351.	μητρί: her name is Thetis, but is not yet mentioned, as it was
well known to the hearers of the bard. She had been wooed by Zeus
and Poseidon, but when Zeus learned that she was fated to bear a son
mightier than his father, he forced her against her will, goddess though
she was, to marry Peleus, by whom she bore Achilles. When Achilles
set out for the Trojan war, she packed his trunk with plenty of warm
woolen articles of wear, deserted her husband, and returned to her old
home in the sea, that she might be near her beloved son in whose
fortunes she took a passionate interest.

Xttpas όρί-yvis : when the ancients prayed they regularly stretched out
then- hands in the direction of the divinity whom they entreated. If
this were a god of heaven, they lifted up their hands toward the sky; if
a god of the sea, they stretched out their hands as Achilles does here;
if a god of the lower world, they might even sit down and beat upon
the ground to attract his attention.

352.	It is a distinctly human touch that Achilles should turn to his
mother for consolation; for women are often inchned to be sympathetic
and to take the side of their childreu. Thus when Aphrodite gets her
hand scratched in battle by the spear of Diomedes, she shrieks aloud,
and hurries back to heaven, where she falls into her mother’s lap and
sobs out her grief. Her mother of course consoles her, and strokes the
hand which has been hurt, and it is all cured once more. In the same
way a modern mother might kiss her little child’s head which he
bumped when he fell down. On the other hand, Ares, the god of war,

<pb n="155"/>378]

HOMERIC GREEK

who has been severely wounded in battle, but who is out of favor with
his mother, is stupid enough to carry his tale of woe to his father.
Homer says, “ swiftly he came to the gods’ dwelling, steep Olympus,
and sat beside Zeus, son of Cronus, with grief in his heart, and showed
the immortal blood flowing from the wound, and piteously spake to him
winged words. . . . Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at
him and said : ‘ Nay, tliou renegade, sit not beside me and whine.’ ”

352. μ.ινυνθά8ιον: Achilles had the choice of a long and inglorious
life, or one short and full of renown. He had chosen the latter, and
now that he has made this choice, his situation is one of deep pathos.
It is this certainty of an early death which casts its gloom over all the
rest of his days. He seems later to have become somewhat more reconciled
to this, and when he is entreated with piteous words by one of the
Trojans to spare his life, he says, “ Aye, friend, thou too must die : why
lamentest thou? Patroclus too is dead, who was better far than thou.
Seest thou not also what manner of man am I for might and goodliness?
Yet over me too hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or
eve or some noonday when my life too some man shall take in battle,
whether with spear he smite or arrow from the string.” The old Greeks
were so in love with life that death seemed clothed with more than
ordinary gloom. When Odysseus meets the soul of Achilles in Hades
he tries to console him by saying “ As for thee, Achilles, none other
than thou wast heretofore the most blessed of men, nor shall any be
hereafter. For of old, in the days of thy life, we Argives gave thee one
honor with the gods, and now thou art a great prince here among the
dead. Wherefore let not thy death be any grief to thee, Achilles.”
But Achilles replies, “Nay, speak not to me comfortably of death, O
great Odysseus. Rather would I live on ground as the hireling of
another, with a landless man who had no great livelihood, than to rule
over all that have gone down to death.”

353.	τιμήν: emphatic by position, showing how keenly the old Greek
heroes thirsted for glory, and how bitterly they resented any affront to
their honor.

354.	ϋψιβρίμί'τηϊ: thunder and lightning were ordinary accompaniments
of the gods of old. In fact, primitive man often thought that
thunder was the actual voice of his god, who thus roared, growled, and
muttered on high. In Hebrew, for example, the ordinary expression for
thunder is qol Jahweh, “the voice of Jehovah.” “Jehovah shall roar
from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall
mightily roar against his fold.” “And Jehovah shall roar from Zion,
and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth

<pb n="156"/>LESSON LIX

[379-380

shall shake.” “ Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the muttering
that goeth out of his mouth. He sendeth it forth under the whole
heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice
roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: God thundereth
marvelously with his voice.” “ And Jehovah thundered from heaven,
and the Most High uttered his voice. And he sent out arrows and scattered
them; lightning and discomfited them.” “ And it came to pass
on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings,
and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet
exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mount.”
Even in a later age the voice of a divinity might in some cases he mistaken
for thunder by the uninitiated : “ Then came there a voice from
heaven, saying, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people
therefore, that stood by and heard it, said that it thundered: others
said, An angel spake to him.”

and quite as true- to nature that Achilles should unburden his woes,

here.

absolutely truthful account of matters. Naturally he does not emphasize
his own part wherein he might be blamed, in calling the assembly
without the sanction of the king, or even without consulting him, and
then bluntly coming forward with a public proposal that the expedition
be given up, and later instigating the seer to make his declaration, which
was the immediate cause of Agamemnon’s violent outburst.

Psestum, the Greek Poseidonia, was a colony of Sybaris. The malarial atmosphere of the
place led to its desertion in the ninth century of our era. Hence the buildings there were not
used as quarries for later structures. The so-called “Temple of Neptune (Poseidon)” at
Psestum is one of the best preserved monuments of antiquity.

commonly have clouds at their command, either to bring rain, or often
in which to wrap themselves. “ Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving ;
sing praise upon the harp to our God: who covereth the heaven with
clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth.” “And Jehovah went before
them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way; and by night in.
a pillar of fire to give them light.” “And the glory of Jehovah abode
upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh
day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.”

which would give added weight to the prayer of Thetis for help to the
Trojans.

back the Achaeans to their ships, and give them a taste of defeat under

poems who suffers human woe. Her motherly affection for her only

whole existence.

423-4. This is to explain why his request cannot be granted immediately.
It also motivates the inactivity of Achilles for this period, thus
throwing into strong relief his abiding anger. The gods were always
ready to enjoy a good dinner. Here there is a more or less conscious
contrast between tlieir happy, care-free existence and that of the heroes
of the Iliad, which was so full of bitter sorrow. This verse seems to be
in contradiction with the preceding account, according to which Apollo
is at hand, shooting his arrows; Hera is in heaven, from which she
sends Athena, who returns thither to the other divinities. But the poet
could count on the indulgence of his hearers not to be hypercritical in
such matters. His desire to produce striking dramatic effects, and to
motivate various actions, sometimes leads him into such slight inconsistencies,
and the same can be said of many another great author.

ἈΙΘιοπήαϊ: it is a characteristic of the earlier civilizations and was
insisted upon even as late as the eighteenth century by the French
philosophers and their followers, to think of primitive men as living in

[394

a purer and more moral form than tlieir later and more degenerate
descendants, who have been corrupted by their culture and lost their
original simplicity» Thus Kousseau {The Inequality of Man) : “Men
are bad; my own sad experience furnishes the proof; yet man is naturally
good, as I think I have shown. What then can so have degraded
him except the changes in his condition, the progress he has made, and
the knowledge he has acquired ? ” In another place {Emile) he says:
“ Coming from the hand of the Author of all things, everything is good;
in the hands of man everything degenerates. Man obliges one soil to
nourish the productions of another, one tree to bear the fruits of
another; he mingles and confounds climates, elements, seasons; he
mutilates his dog, his horse, his slave. He overturns everything, disfigures
everything; he loves deformity, monsters; he desires that nothing
should be as nature made it, not even man himself. To please him,
man must be broken in like a horse; man must be adapted to Man’s
own fashion, like a tree in his garden.” Cf. the note on vs. 272, § 355.

These verses give the final touches to the structure which furnishes a
reasonable motive for Achilles to remain inactive instead of returning
home as he had threatened (vs. 169).

mony, as the modern Roman Catholics use holy water. “ And Jehoyah
spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a layer of brass, and
Ms foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put water therein.
For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash
with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to
minister, to burn offering made by lire unto Jehovah: so they shall
wash their hands and their feet, that they die not.”

οϋλοχύτάϊ: the use of whole barleycorns is a survival, due to religious
conservatism, of a distinctly primitive practice. ‘At an early day, before
men knew how to grind their grain, they offered it whole to their gods.
As civilization advanced, religious ceremonies, with their static tendency,
remained practically unchanged, and whole barleycorns were still offered
to their gods. In the same way the feast of unleavened bread among
the old Hebrews was probably a survival of a primitive practice, inherited
from a stage when they had not yet learned the use of leaven.

vengeance upon the Greeks (vs. 37 ff.), and furthermore we are told in
identically the same words at the end: τον S’ ίκλνε Φοίβος Ἀπόλλων.
Thus the second prayer is intended by the poet to echo the first, and to
bring this situation more vividly before the minds of his hearers. This
furnishes a good example, and the first in European literature, of what
is known as a palinode.

lacked the stern simplicity of the rustic poet,
claimed that this would be more suitable as
a drink for fishes than for men.

414.	471. πάσιν : , 995. — διπά«σσιν : 1005. — ίπαρξάμίνοι refers to the
beginning of their religious ceremony, which was performed in this case
by each of those present pouring a few drops of wine from his cup as a
libation before the drinking began. The libation corresponded to the
“ drink offerings”pi the Old Testament. “In the holy place shalt thou
cause the strong;wine to be poured unto Jehovah for a drink offering.”
The worshippers thus shared their food and drink (communion) with
their god. According to primitive ideas, those who eat of the same loaf
an4 drink of the same cup become of the same flesh and blood when the

<pb n="175"/>415-416]

HOMERIC GREEK

food is assimilated into their bodies. This would thus establish and
maintain the strongest possible bond between the divinity and his
worshippers. “ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion
of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion
of the body of Christ? seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one
body; for we all partake of the one bread.” “ But I say that the things
which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God : and
I would not that ye should have communion with devils.”

472.	μολπή : 1005, with song and dance. Singing has always been
looked upon as a suitable form of expression for pleasing a divinity.
Dancing also was long considered a form of religious exercise, and is
still found as such among many savag’e tribes. “ Let the children of
Zion be joyful in their king. Let them praise his name in the dance:
let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp.” “ And
David danced before Jehovah with all his might.”

473.	παιήονα: 1012 (παιω, strike) : originally an epithet of Apollo,
the “ striker,” “ beater,” “ rapper,” who heals by his magic stroke.
Then the song having this word as a refrain; cf. “ Te Deum,” a hymn
of thanksgiving, which is a type of song so named from its opening
words: “ Te Deum laudamus.”

474.	μ^λποντΕϊ ρΕκάρΕργον; praising the free-worlcer with song and
dance, that is, singing a song of which Apollo was the theme, praising
Apollo in song and dance, the most important part being the dance.
The god can hear the song and see the dance, although he is far away
in the land of the Ethiopians (vs. 424). — φρίνα: 1014.

477. ροδοδάκτιιλοϊ: the old Greeks had observed the long streamers of

Jehovah, living on Sinai, and in heaven, being anthropomorphic, yet
omnipotent, etc. Olympus was so high that its top reached above the
clouds to heaven, where in the bright and sunny sky were the mansions
of the' gods. Heaven and Olympus seem to be used here, as elsewhere
in Homer, synonymously, without any very consistent picture in the
mind of the poet. Apparently the earlier belief in a physical Mount
Olympus as the abode of the gods was passing through a stage in which
it was rapidly becoming idealized, following pretty much the same
course as the Christian belief in a heaven and a hell, which were once
thought of as very real places.

would never have allowed it to take place, nor would Thetis have been
foolish enough to have attempted it in her presence. Furthermore, as
we shall soon see, Zeus had an unhappy home life, and perhaps he has
come here to get a little peace.

else is holding him back.

To get the full benefit of this scene, it. must be understood that
although Thetis addresses Zeus as πάτερ (vs. 503), this is merely an honorary
title, to indicate his majesty and superior power among all the gods
and men. As a matter of fact, Thetis was an old flame of Zeus. She
must he thought of as eternally young and surpassingly beautiful.

<pb n="181"/>431-132]

HOMERIC GREEK

reward Paris for showing such good -judgment, gave him Helen, the most
beautiful woman in the world, to be his wife. But as Helen was already
married to Menelaus, her elopement with Paris to Troy brou ght on the
Trojan War, undertaken by the Greeks for the purpose of bringing her
home.

The abject terror of the father of gods and men, who raises his voice
almost to a whimper, as he tells how he is imposed upon at home, is
intended by the poet to produce a comic effect, and the remainder of the
first book of the Iliad is not merely comical but ludicrous at times.
This is carefully worked out by the poet, not merely as furnishing a
foil to his heroes, but for the purpose of providing a rest for his hearers and
a highly acceptable variety after the tensely tragical scenes of the preceding.
This whole passage, with the differences in tone of voice, gesture, and
manner, would offer especial opportunities to the bard in reciting his verses.

It seems hardly chivalrous of Zeus to drag out the skeleton from the
family closetforthe inspection of Thetis, but he must remove the suspicion,
half expressed by her in vs. 516, that he does not care for her. Throughout
this whole scene he treats Thetis as though she were an innocent
little girl, whom he is anxious to please, even at the expense of his own
discomfort. So he says in his kindest tones: “You hurry along back
home, and I will attend to all this. Only make sure that Hera doesn’t
see you.” It would have created a most disagreeable scene if Hera had
caught her.

the nod of Zeus establishes his word as truthful and irrevocable,
whereas he plainly intimates that any mere promise on his part might be
deceitful and might be broken at any time, if it so pleased him. This
idea may go back to the practice which the images of the gods sometimes
had of nodding a confirmation to some of the prayers offered in the temples.

■world, his statue of the Olympian Zeus, made of gold and ivory, of colossal
size, and reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
It was a work of such marvelous art that it was considered a misfortune
to die without having seen it. The calm majesty of these verses is in
marked contrast to the preceding anxious fear of Hera, just displayed
by the father of gods and men, which gives almost a grotesque effect.
It may be that the poet intended something of the kind in making
Olympus tremble at his nod, as on another occasion Hera makes Olympus
tremble by bouncing angrily about on her throne. The presence or
movements of divinities commonly made the earth and mountains trem-

thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked
greatly.” “Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou
marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
dropped, the clouds also dropped water. The mountains quaked at the
presence of Jehovah.” “Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations
of heaven moved, and were shaken, because he was wroth.”

43 8 . 537. οί: 1004. Hera shows a keenly feminine instinct. Without
having to be told, she recognizes the situation. Perhaps Zeus
showed his guilt in his countenance, or else he may have looked more
fearful than usual. Of course she loses no time in giving him a “piece
of her mind,” and turns loose all her pent-up fury. In addition to forming
a pleasing variety, this scene is employed by the poet to make his
hearers more familiar with the attitude of the other divinities toward
the βονλη of Zeus (vs. 5), upon which the action of the whole poem
turns.

538.	The “Old Man of the Sea” was Nereus.

539.	κερτομίοισι (μνθοισιν) : 1005. Hera does not even wait for the
father of gods and men to catch his breath and collect his thoughts, but
pours out upon him a flood of bitter and abusive language.

540.	tol : 1004. — αΰ may indicate mere impatience, “ what now,” but
more probably means “ again, once more,” and would indicate that this
is not the first time that such a scene had taken place. Zeus was
preeminently the Don Juan of the gods. Hera naturally, resents his
policy of secrecy in keeping everything hid from her. The soul· of
Agamemnon in Hades, who had a particularly hard time of it with his
.awn wife, and was finally killed by her with an ax, thus advises
Odysseus: “ Wherefore, do thou too never be soft even to thy wife, neither
show her all the counsel that thou knowest, but a part declare and let a
part be hid. . . . And yet another tiling will I tell thee, and do thou
ponder it in thy heart. Put thy ship to land in secret, and not openly,
on the shore of thy dear country; for there is no more faith in woman.”

[439-440

543.	πρόφρων receives emphasis from its position. Perhaps a slight
intimation that Zeus will have to tell any way, even if he does not do it·
“eagerly.”

544.	The conception of a god as a father is a common one, and well
known to most Christians from the opening words of the “ Pater Noster.”

545.	Zeus begins in a grandiose style, and tells Hera pompously (the
spondaic ending of vs. 548 helps to give this effect) that his plans are
too deep for her understanding, seeing that she is only a woman.
Whenever he wants her to know anything he will tell her, so far as it
may be proper for her to hear. And further, just think! he will tell
her the very first, before anybody else. She must keep quiet now, and
stop prying into his private affairs. All this serves merely to confirm
her suspicions and opens the way for a more direct attack. The whole
attitude of Zeus toward Hera is pretty much the same as that which
furnishes the theme of Ibsen’s “ The Doll’s House.”

553. She throws back at Zeus his own words (άρομαι, μεταλλάω) in
an indignant denial of having been too inquisitive heretofore. On the
other hand, she has never before this (πάρος) inquired into his private
affairs, “but now (jvCv) this is too much for a loving and faithful wife
like me to endure.”

557. troi: 1004. — γοόνων: 983.

561.	δαιμονίη: “thou fool.” — ouo.1 echoes the oiu> of vs. 558. Hera
there says, “I imagine,” to which Zeus replies, “Yes, you are always
imagining.” If llera has only made a shrewd guess, the towering rage
into -which Zeus falls at being so neatly caught would be the best possible
confirmation of her suspicions. — oihi rt λήθω : i.e. “You are always
spying on me.”

562.	αϊτό θϋμοΰ: farther from my heart, i.e. you will lose my affec-

tions.— π-ρήξαι: in this connection it is interesting to observe how
well the poet knew human life ; for later Hera does succeed in outwitting
Zeus and does accomplish (πρηζαι) just what she had in mind here,
which Zeus is compelled in his discomfiture to acknowledge: “ Thou
hast accomplished it at last, O Hera, ox-eyed queen, thou hast aroused
Achilles fleet of foot.”	✓

564.	“ Granted that this is true ” (which I do not). Zeus cannot
bring himself to make a clean breast of it. — έμοὶ φίλον: autocratic and
arbitrary: car tel est noire Ion plahir. Such is my good pleasure, reason
enough for the likes of you ; cf. Shakespeare, Jul. Cues., “ Decius, go tell
them (the senators) Caesar will not come.” “ Most mighty Caesar, let
me know some cause, lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.” “ The
cause is in my will, I will not come, that is enough to satisfy the senate.”

565.	άκίουο-α : translate by another imperative, “ But shut up and sit
down.”—μυθω: 996. Zeus has lost completely in the argument, which
makes him very angry, so he now turns to threats of the direst violence.
These are not merely empty words either, as we know from another
occasion, when he tauntingly reminds Hera that he had once hung her
up with her hands tied together and an anvil bound to either foot. On
that occasion he threatened to horsewhip her severely. Like patient
Job, he finds his own wife too much to endure.

567. ίφίίω must be understood of blow's as violent as Zeus had the
power to deliver them. — ίόνθ’ (ιόντα) (pie).

This method of silencing Hera, contrary to ordinary human experience
in such matters, proves effective. It is necessary for the poetic
■ economy that she be stopped, so that there may be further development
in the action of the poem. Besides she is bright enough to sec that the
best method of having her way is by apparent submission.

Hephaestus essays the role of mediator, as Nestor did between Agamemnon
and Achilles, but with infinitely better success. He is evidently
much worried that they two should create such a disturbance
over such insignificant creatures as mortals. Ινεκα. θνητῶν is said with
the utmost contempt, as being au unworthy cause for such wrangling.
Thus, on another occasion, when Poseidon challenges Apollo to a combat,
because of their having taken different sides in the Trojau war, Apollo
loftily replies, “ Shaker of the earth, thou wouldst consider me of unsound
mind if I should fight against thee for the sake of pitiful mortals, who
like unto leaves now live a glowing life, consuming the fruit of the
earth, and now again waste away in death.” On another occasion· the
poet says : “ This is the lot the gods have spun for miserable men, that
they should live in pain : yet themselves are sorrowless.”

580.	ίθέλησιν : 1135. — 580-581 : a good example of the figure known
as aposiopesis, i.e., instead of completing his sentence, the god breaks off
abruptly, and leaves to the imagination, as being beyond the power of
adequate expression in words, just what Zeus might do to them all, if
he should take the notion. It may be that Hephaestus is afraid to say
what will happen, for fear that a mere “absit omen” spoken thereafter
may not be sufficient to keep Zeus from doing this, and he fears to put
such an idea into the head of his still scowling, muttering father.

591. troSos: 983. Apparently Zeus seized Hephaestus by one foot,
twirled him a time or so around his head, as he would a rabbit, and
then let go. —-·άπο βηλοΰ : from the threshold (of the palace in heaven).

Evidently Zeus enjoyed throwing the gods out of heaven, to vent his
rage when angry, as he boasts of this on another occasion: “ 0 Hera,
hard to deal with. Nay but yet I know not whether thou mayest not
be the first to reap the fruits of thy cruel treason, and I beat thee with
stripes. Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high,
and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands I fastened
a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang
in the clear air and in the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high
Olympus, but they could not come round and loose thee. Nay, whomsoever
I might catch, I would clutch, and hurl from the threshold, to
come fainting to the earth.” The poet tells us that on another occasion,
“ But ZeuS, when he awakened, was wrathful, aud dashed the gods
about his mansion.” He was once deceived by the goddess of folly,

HOMERIC GREEK

Atιέ. Thereupon “ he seized At6 by her bright-haired head in the anger
of his soul, and sware a mighty oath that never again to Olympus and
the starry heaven should Atd come, who blindeth all alike. He said,
and whirling her in his hand flung her from the starry heaven, and
quickly she arrived among the works of men.”

We need not demand of our poet absolute consistency in the treatment
of various features of his theme; and it would be idle to ask how
a god could fall to earth, if thrown out of heaven, when we see them
making daily trips from heaven to earth and return, through the air,
passing from one to the other in a moment, or very quickly, and without
any external assistance. This conception of the fall of Hephaestus,

From a vase painting by Duris

so crudely anthropomorphic, is matched by the Christian legend of
Satan having been thrown out of heaven, as developed in Milton’s
Paradise Lost. The poet is a little confused also in his topography here,
for if the seat of the gods is on the top of Mount Olympus, it would not
be possible for Hephaestus to occupy much time in falling to the earth.

592.	ήμαρ: 1015. This would indicate that the home of the gods
was much higher than Olympus could be.

593.	Konnrtcrov = κατα-7τεσον = κατ-πεσον, 608-609. — ίν Λήμνω : Lemnos

454. 599. The drinks were uguaily sefyed in Olympus by the goddess
Hebe, whose name has become a synonymn for feminine grace and
maidenly beauty. In marked contrast to her is Hephaestus, rough,
ungainly, and distressingly homely, who here makes his debut as cupbearer
to the gods, and goes through so many funny motions (cf.
Charlie Chaplin) that all of them laugh most uproariously.

θεοΐσιν: 1004, 1009. This inextinguishable laughter is well motivated
psychologically; as the situation has been so exceptionally tense that
when there is a change brought about by the comic figupeof Hephaestus
and his recital of his discomfiture at the hands of Zeus, all are ready
to give vent to their pent-up feelings in this undignified fashion.

600. ΐΓοιίΓνΐίοντα is onomatopoetic; we can hear the bow-legged,

Iiomer tells us elsewhere that song and dance are the crown of the
feast; and thus the muses would be able to display their varied grace
and charms to the best advantage. The book thus begins with the
heroic and tragic figures of Achilles and Agamemnon, and ends with a
cabaret show among the gods of Olympus. — on-C: 1005.

606.	κακκείοντες = κατακείοντες [κατακείω] : 608-609.

Christian conception of heaven as a city, the new Jerusalem. ·

[455

455. The first book of the Iliad, after its grim and gloomy beginning
! amidst the tragedy of earthly life and its unending sorrows, closes amid
-the laughter of the care-free blessed gods, feasting happily on Olympus,
■ “ where, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast forever.
Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow
come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and
the white light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all
their days.” This alternate play of light and shade, of laughter and
of tears, of stern, dignified men, and frivolous, lighthearted gods, who
serve as their foil, is worked out by the poet with remarkable artistic
feeling and delicacy of touch. The scene on Olympus as contrasted
with the earlier action may best be compared to a satyr play, a kind of
burlesque show, which was regularly performed in ancient Athens at
the close of a series of tragedies, and for the same purpose, to relieve
the minds of the audience.	->

With surpassing art the poet has woven into the action and the
narrative of this book the most important characters, both human and
divine, of the entire poem.

“No book of Homer is so full of dramatic groups and situations as
this : Apollo striding with his bow and ringing quiver; Thetis caressing
the grieving and angry Achilles; Thetis before Zeus, clasping· bis knees
and extending her right hand toward his chin; Zeus with his dark
brows and ambrosial locks nodding a confirmation to his promise;
Chryses with his filleted scepter and his gifts, before the two sons cf
Atreus; Odysseus at the altar of Apollo with the maiden whom he is
restoring to her aged father, — with his companions and the hecatomb ;
Achilles in his rage drawing his sword from its sheath, calmed by
Athena, who takes him by his long locks, — with Agamemnon before
him and the other chiefs around him; the heralds of Agamemnon at
the tent of Achilles, as Patroclus leads forth the fair Briseis; Zeus and
Hera on Olympus, with Hephaestus playing the part of Hebd; the
assembly of the gods, Apollo playing the lyre, and the singing muses.”

<pb n="199"/>456-463]

HOMERIC GREEK

INTRODUCTION TO ATTIC GREEK

456. Dialects. — The Greek language was divided into a number
of dialects, the most important groups of which were the
Aeolic, Ionic (Ionic-Attic), and Doric.

457. Very closely related to Ionic is Attic, and both are usually
grouped together as Ionic-Attic. In the great mass of their forms
they are fundamentally alike, and differ
only in minor details.

458.	The Homeric poems are composed
in what is known as the Homeric dialect,
a mixture of Aeolic and Ionic, the bulk of
the forms being Ionic (620).

459.	Contraction. — Attic carries the
contraction of vowels to a further extent
than does any other of the Greek dialects,
two or more vowels coming together and
admitting of contraction practically never
remaining uncontracted.

460.	Hence one of the most important
things for the student to do in passing
from Homeric to Attic Greek is to memorize
thoroughly the table of contractions
(584-585).

461.	In general vowels are contracted
in Attic as in Homer (584-585), the only
exceptions being that ε + ο and ε + οὐ = οὐ
in Attic instead of εὐ in Homer.

	Strigil (Apoxyomenus)

		original by Lysippus, a fourth
		century sculptor</p>
	</head>
</note>

462.	Treatment of ᾱ in Attic. — After e, i, p, the ἡ of Homer,
when representing an earlier ᾱ (621), becomes ᾱ in Attic, except
that ρϝη = ρη, as κόρη for κόρϝη = Homeric κουρη maiden and ρση =
ρρη, as θάρρος for θάρσος <gloss>courage</gloss>.

463.	If ρη is the product of the contraction of ρεα (584-585) it
remained unchanged, as ὄρη = ὄρεα  <gloss>mountains</gloss>.

<pb n="200"/>

464. Use of Vau. — Vau had gone entirely out of use in Attic
before Attic literature begins, and it had no influence on Attic verse.

465. Consonantal change. — 

1) σσ of Homer becomes rr in Attic,
as θάλασσα, πρήσσω of Homer become θάλαπα, πράπω in Attic;
except that two sigmas brought together by inflection become σ,
as ποσὶ for ποσσὶ (ποδσι), ἔπεσι for ἔπεσσι, τελέσαι for τελέσσαι.

2) ρσ of Homer becomes ρρ in Attic.

466.	Inflection. — In the inflection of
words, the chief differences between the
Homeric and Attic forms are due to the
greater extent to which the Attic dialect
carries either contraction (584-585), or to
which it carries metathesis of quantity
(573).

467.	Thus Homeric θαλασσάων, ἥρωι.

ἥρώα, ἔπεος, ἔπεα, γέραος, γέραα, πόληος, βασιλῆος, 
βασιλῆα, βασιλήων, βασιλῆας, νηάς, νηῶν
regularly become in Attic θαλαπῶν, ἥρῳ,

ἥρω, ἔπους, ἔπη, γἐρως, γέρᾱ, πόλeως, βασιλέως, 
βασιλέᾱ, βασιλέων, βασιλέᾱς, νεώς, νεῶν.

468.	Nouns and adjectives. — Attic had
the following case endings, either not
found or else very uncommon in Homer:

1)	Dual, gen. and dat. end in -ιν instead of -ιιν.

<note>The Discus Thrower
(Discobolus)

Lancelotti Palace, Rome
Marble copy of the bronze
original by Myron, a fifth century
sculptor</note>



2) Dual of the first decl., gen. and dat. ends in -αιν.



3)	The dative plural of all three declensions regularly lias the
shorter forms : in the first declension -αις, in the second declension
-ois, in the third declension -σι.

4)	The gen. sing. masc. of the first declension ends in -ov.

5)	The gen. sing, of nouns and adjectives with stems in ην, ι, υ is regularly-εως.

6)	The acc. plur. of masc. and fem. nouns and adjectives with stems in ηυ, ι, υ, ες regularly ends in -εις.

<pb n="201"/>



7)	Comparatives with, stems in -or, as ἀμείνων, may end in : ω in
the acc. sing., masc. and fern., and in the nom., acc., and voc. plur.
neuter; and may end in -ους in the nom., acc., and voc. plur.
masc. and fern.

469.	For the irregular “ Attic Second Declension,” and the
declension of adjectives as ΐλεως, ων, of ναΰς, and of ypav; see any
good Greek grammar.

470.	Pronouns. — For the declension of the personal, interrogative,
indefinite, and reflexive pronouns, see any good Greek grammar.

471.	Verbs.
— Attic Greek has the future optative and future
passive, entirely regular in formation, which may be easily learned
from any good Greek grammar.

472.	The middle optative, third plural, regularly ends in -ντο
instead of in -ατο as in Homer ; and -ατο is very rare as the ending
of the third plural of Attic verbs.

473.	For the Attic forms of regular -μι verbs, see any good
Greek grammar.

474.	For the Attic forms of the irregular verbsp-riju, εΐμι, φημί,
ημαι, κείμαι, and οίδα, see any good Greek grammar.

475.	The first perfect active of verbs, as λελνκα (904), is common
and is the regular form in Attic Greek for verbs with all
classes of stems.

476.	In many second perfects with stems in -π-, β, κ, y, the final
mute of the stem is asjjirated (619), v and β becoming φ, while κ
and y become y. Thus πέπομφα \_πεμπω~\, τετριφα. [τρΓ/3ω], ηχα
[αγω], διδίωχα [διώκω].

477.	Contracted nouns, adjectives, and verbs. —For the inflection
of contract nouns, adjectives, and verbs, see any good Greek
grammar.

478.	The following table for Attic forms, corresponding to the
table in 649 for Homeric forms, indicates the resultant endings
produced by the fusion of the case endings with the stem^of nouns
and adjectives.

HOMERIC GREEK

SYNTAX

480.	The differences in Homeric and Attic syntax can best be
learned by the careful study of some good work on Attic prose

composition.

481.	The article. — In Attic Greek 6, f/, to is regularly employed
as the definite article (the), its absence ordinarily marking a noun
as indefinite, as ὁ πόλεμος the war, πόλεμος war.

482.	At times the article may be omitted, especially in poetry
without marking the noun as indefinite.

483.	At times it may represent the unemphatic possessive pronoun,
as Kνρος καταπεύήσάς από τον ἀρματος τον θωρηκα ἐνεύν καί
ἀναβας επὶ τον ίππον τα πάλτα εις τας χεΐρας ελαβε Oyrus, having
leaped down from his chariot, put on his breastplate, and having
mounted his horse took his javelins in his hands.

484.	It may be employed, especially with adjectives and
participles, in a generic sense, denoting a class, as ὁ ἀνθρωπος
manQcind), οι ἀ-γαθοὶ the good, b βονλόμενος anyone who wishes, oi
•γέροντες the aged.

485.	It may be used with proper names in familiar style, as b
Σωκράτης Socrates.

486.	It is used in a variety of ways to form substantives :

1)	With adjectives and participles, as oi πλούσιοι the rich, oi
7ταράντες those present.

2)	With possessive pronouns, as oi σοὶ your people, τα ημέτερα.

our possessions, our affairs.

3)	With genitives, as ®ονκν8ί8ης b ’Ολόρον Thucydides, son of
Olorus.

4)	With locatives, as oi MapaiWt καὶ Ίαλαμΐvi those (who fought)
at Marathon and Salamis, τα οίκοι affairs, things at home.

5)	With adverbs, as oi vvv the people of to-day, oi τότε those of that
time, oi εκεὶ those over there.

6)	With prepositional phrases, as oi ἐν τω α,στει those in the city,
τα προς τον πόλεμον the things (needful) for the war.

<pb n="204"/>INTRODUCTION TO ATTIC GREEK

[487

7)	The neuter article is prefixed to any word or part of speech
when considered merely as an expression, as to λε'γει the word
“ λεγει,” to yviodi σεαντόν the (saying) “ know thyself”

8)	The neuter article in the singular, all cases, is used with the
infinitive (articular infinitive), when emphasizing the substantive
character of the infinitive. In this usage it is commonly translated
by the English verbal noun in -ing, as το καλώ·: μάχεσθαι
(the act of) fighting bravely, to fight bravely, to ypafiuv (nom.)
writing, τον γράφειν of writing, τω γράφειν to, or for writing, το
γράφειν (acc.) icriting. Note. — The article is always thus used
with the infinitive when the infinitive is construed with a
preposition.

487. Verbal adjectives. — In addition to verbal adjectives in
-T09, as found in Homer and denoting possibility, or merely as
the equivalent of the perfect passive participle, Attic Greek has
a verbal adjective in -τίο:, similarly formed, and used with dpi
(often omitted), expressing necessity or duty, and admitting of
two constructions :

1)	Personal (passive) construction. Only verbal nouns from
transitive verbs can be thus employed, the verbal agreeing in
gender and number with the subject. The agent is in the dative,
as ύφελητέὰ σοι ἡ πάλι: Ιστὶ the state must be benefited by you, ov
7τρό ye τη: αλήθεια.·: τιμητέο: ἀνηρ ci man must not be honored before
the truth.

2)	Impersonal (active) construction. In this construction,
which is more frequent, the verbal is active in meaning and
stands in the neuter nominative, usually singular, while its object
is in the case which the finite verb would govern. The agent, if
expressed, is usually in the dative, but is sometimes in the
accusative as if dependent upon δε?, which has a meaning similar
to that contained in these verbals, one must. Thus ίσκψεον σοι
την αρετήν you must Cultivate virtue, tovs φίλον: ινεργετητεον, την
πόλιν ώφελητεον, των βοσκημάτων ετημελητεον One must do favors for
one’s friends, benefit one’s state, and care for one’s cattle, τον
βουλόμενον ἐνδαίμονα είναι σωφροσύνην διωκτεον καὶ ἀσκητεον he who
desires to be happy must pursue and cultivate temperance.

<pb n="205"/>488-500]

HOMERIC GREEK

488. ἀν in Attic. — Attic, which does not employ k?(v), has the
following unhomeric uses of av:

1)	With past tenses, apparently as present conditional, as
ttoWov ἀν aiiov ην το πλόυτΰν el καὶ to χαίρειν αύτω σννην it would be
worth a great deal to be wealthy if joy were associated with it.

2)	With past tenses it takes the place of the iteratives in -σκον,
which are not found in Attic Greek, as ίτρε-πεν ἀν = τρέπεσκεν,
ετρεψεν ἀν = τρέψασκ€ν.

3)	The subjunctive with ἀν is found in general statements
which are valid also for the future, where English employs the
indicative present, as μαινόμίθα πάντα ό-ότ' ἀν ἀργιζωμεθα, tve are all
mad when we are angry.

489—500. These sections, which are omitted from this book for
the sake of brevity, refer to the standard Greek grammars.
Those wishing to learn Attic Greek should now read some good
Attic author, with a few sections from the grammar each day till
the most important fundamentals of Attic Greek become
thoroughly familiar. Bon voyage !

HOMERIC GREEK

502. Only the capitals were used in antiquity, the small
letters being introduced by mediaeval copyists of Greek
manuscripts.

503.	The vowels are: a, e, ἡ, ο, ω, open vowels, and

i, v, closed vowels.

.504. The diphthongs are :

at pronounced as ai in aisle.

“ ou in house (or rather as au in Ger. Haws).

“ ei in freight (or better still, pronounce both
vowels, e + t, but fuse them into a single
syllable ei, with the accent on the first part).
“ eh + oo in spoon, hut fused into one sjdlable,
somewhat as eu in Fr. fleur.

“ ὰ + oo in spoon, but fused into one syllable.

“ oi in boil.

“ ou in soup.

“ we in we (or rather as ui in Fr. lwi).

“ δ + oo in spoon, but fused into one syllable.
yper diphthongs are a, y, ω. These consist of a
long vowel (d, ἡ, ω) with an iota (i), called iota subscript, written
beneath, unless the first of these vowels is a capital, in which
case the iota is written in the line, as ωχετο — Ωιχετο = ΩΙΧΕΤΟ
went.'

Note.—Whenever by inflection (626) or otherwise an iota follows
immediately after d, ἡ, or ω, it regularly becomes iota subscript (505),
thus producing an improper diphthong.

506.	These diphthongs are usually pronounced the same as
d, ἡ, and ω respectively, although in Homeric times the iota was
probably sounded to some extent. 1 2 3

1	f and 9 are not ordinarily printed in Greek texts to-day, but , both were
common in the earlier period of the language ; and a knowledge of tire use
of vau (or digamma, as it is sometimes called) is necessary in order to
understand the metre of Homer, as well as to explain many irregular forms.

2	s at the end of a word ; elsewhere r, as σαώσα$ you will save.

3	Except in diphthongs, where it has the sound of oo in spoon. Eor simple
υ round the lips as though to pronounce oo in spoon, and with them in
this position pronounce long e in me.

<pb/>PRONUNCIATION, CONSONANTS	[507-516

507.	θ, φ, and. χ may be pronounced as indicated above. In
Homeric times they were pronounced somewhat as t-h in fat-head,
p-h in sap-head, and ck-h in thick-head, respectively, but without
the break noticeable in English between the two syllables.

508.	The remaining consonants may be pronounced as specified
in the list, but γ before μ, v, y, χ, or £ is called gamma-nasal,
and is pronounced as n in song, as κλαγγή uproar, pronounced
clahngdy.

509.	Mutes. — The letters π, β, φ; κ, γ, χ; τ, 8, θ are called
mutes or stops.

510.	They are divided into three classes, according to the part
of the mouth most occupied in producing them:

Labial (lip) mutes (π, β, φ), called 7r-mutes.

• Dental (teeth) mutes (τ, δ, 6), called τ-mutes (called also lingual
(tongue) mutes.

Palatal (palate) mutes (κ, γ, χ) calle/1 κ-mutes (called also
guttural (throat) mutes).

511.	Mutes of the same class are called cognate, as being pronounced
by the same organs of speech; lips (labials), tongue and
teeth (linguals, dentals), or palate and throat (palatals, gutturals).

512.	The mutes are also grouped in three orders, according to
the relative amount of expiratory force employed in making
them:

Smooth mutes (τγ, τ, k), called tenues.

Middle mutes (β, 8, γ), called medials.

Rough mutes (φ, θ, χ), called aspirates.

513.	Mutes of the same order are said to be coordinate.

514.	Nasals. — The nasals are μ, v, and γ-nasal (508).

515.	They may also be divided into three classes, corresponding
to the three classes of mutes:

μ a labial. 1

v a dental (lingual).

γ-nasal a palatal (guttural).

516.	Liquids. — The liquids are λ and p, to which are sometimes
added the nasals, μ and v.

<pb n="209"/>517-527]

HOMERIC GREEK

517.	Spirants. — The spirants are σ and p.

518.	Double Consonants. — The double consonants are ζ (= id),
£ (= κσ, γσ, χσ), and ψ (= 7τσ, βσ, φσ).

519.	Quantity. — The vowels -η and ω are always long; c and o
are always short, while α, ι, and υ are sometimes long and sometimes
short, and hence are called doubtful vowels.

520.	When the doubtful vowels are long in this text, it will be
indicated (except in the direct quotations from Homer) by their
having the mark (-) placed over them, as θεὰ goddess. This
mark will not be placed over vowels having the circumflex
accent (534), as they are always long (537).

521.	Diphthongs, including improper diphthongs (505), are
always long.

522.	A syllable is long by nature when it contains a long vowel
or a diphthong. It is long by position when its vowel is followed
by two or more consonants, or by a double consonant (518).

523.	One or both of the consonants which make a syllable long
by position may come in the following word.

524.	If a mute (509), followed by a liquid (516), or by the
nasals μ or ν, comes after a short vowel, and the mute and liquid
(or nasal) come within the same word or the same part of a compound,
the syllable is common, that is, it may be either long or
short, according to the requirements of the verse.

525.	Sometimes a short vowel followed by λ, μ, ν or ρ (occasionally
σ or Ϝ) forms a syllable long by position, in which case
these consonants seem to have been doubled in pronunciation,
and are sometimes so written.



526.	One of the consonants which make a syllable long by
position (particularly Ϝ, occasionally σ) is sometimes lost, but in
many of these cases the Ϝ was probably pronounced in Homeric
times.

527.	Breathings. — Every vowel at the beginning of a word
must have either the smooth breathing (᾽) or the rough breathing (῾),
written over it if it is a small letter, and before it if it is an

<pb n="210"/>QUANTITY, BREATHINGS, ACCENTS [528-538

initial capital followed by small letters. If the entire word is
written in capitals, the breathing is omitted.

528.	The rough breathing, called aspiration, shows that h was
sounded before the vowel, as ἱστός loom, mast (pronounced
histós).

529.	Initial p always has the rough breathing ; initial v usually
has it.

530.	The smooth breathing denotes that the vowel was sounded
without the h, as epos my, mine (pronounced emos).

531.	A diphthong, except an improper one (505) at the beginning
of a word takes the breathing over its second vowel, as
Ἀυτός (αυτός) self (pronounced owtos), Υιός (υιός) son (pronounced

Jrneos).

532.	Improper diphthongs take the breathing over the first

vowel when it is a small letter, and before it when it is an initial
capital followed by small letters.	*

533.	In compounds no word is written with a breathing unless
it be initial, even though it originally had it, as ξννίημχ (βιν + ΐημι)
bring together, hearken to. In such cases the rough breathing
should be pronounced.

534.	Accents.—There are three accents, the acute Q, the
grave ('), and the circumflex ("), as βουλή a plan, βουλή καλή a
good plan, μήνις wrath.

535.	These accents are all ordinarily pronounced alike, by
stressing the accented syllable, as in English. In ancient Greek
they seem to have represented a difference of pitch.

536.	The acute accent can stand on one of the last three
syllables only of a word, the circumflex on one of the last two
only, and the grave on the last only.

537.	The circumflex accent can stand only over a long vowel
or a diphthong.

538.	If diphthongs (except improper ones, 505) have either
the accent or breathing, or both, these must come over the second
vowel, as αντονς themselves, οννικα because, οντος (Οντος) this.

<pb n="211"/>539-548]

HOMERIC GREEK

539.	For improper diphthongs, these come over the first vowel
if it is written in small letters, and before it if it is an initial
capital followed by small letters.

540.	If a vowel or a diphthong has both the accent and
breathing, the acute and grave follow the breathing, while the
circumflex is placed' over the breathing, as ava£ king, protecting
lord, ύστερον afterward(s), 5s ϊφατο thus he spoke, ΐφι mightily,
with might.

541.	If the accented vowel is initial, the accent as well as the
breathing stands over it if it is a small letter and before it if it
is a capital followed by small letters, as ἀιδι to Hades, "Ολυμπος
Olympus, ἀλγος grief, pain, woe.

542.	If the entire word is written in capitals, both breathing
and accent are omitted.

543.	The last syllable of a word is called the ultima, the last
but one. the penult, and the last but two the antepenult.

544.	The antepenult when accented must have the acute, but
it cannot have the accent if the last syllable is long by nature
(522), or ends in either of the double consonants £ or p, as ίλωριον
booty, but Ιλωρίον (gen.) of booty.

545.	An accented penult has the circumflex if it is long by
nature (522), while the ultima is short by nature, as σκηπτρον
sceptre.

546.	An accented ultima may have the acute when short, as
καλός good, the acute or circumflex when long, as ψϋχή soul, ψϋχης
(gen.) of a soul.

547.	Final ai and oi are counted short when determining the
accent, except in the optative and in olpoi (loc.) at home, as μΰθοι.
(545) words, θάλασσαi (544) seas. These diphthongs are regularly
long in metrical quantity, and must be so treated when reading
the verse, although considered short when determining the
accent.

548.	Verbs regularly have the recessive accent, that, is, their
accent is thrown as far back to the left as the rules of accent will
allow.

<pb n="212"/>National Museum, Athens
Found at Athens in 1880. A marble statuette copy of Athena by Phidias, placed in
the Parthenon in 488 b.c. The original, nearly forty feet high, had ivory for the face,
feet, and hands, and gold for the drapery and accessories.
<pb/>ACCENT, PROCLITICS, ENCLITICS [549-554

549.	A word wjxli the acute on the last syllable is called
oxytone (sharpjnried).

550.	Oxytones change the acute to the grave before other
words, not separated by punctuation marks, in the same sentence,
except before enclitics (553), elided syllables (575), or the interrogative
pronoun tls, t'l who % which ? what ? as ἀνὰ up, up through,
but dra στρατόν up through the camp.

551.	Proclitics. — Some monosyllables have no accent of their
own and are closely attached to the following word, as iv χερσίν
in his hands, where iv has no accent of its own, just as in the
ordinary use of the (unemphatic) definite and indefinite article
in English. These words in Greek are called proclitics, and are
accented only —

1)	when followed by an enclitic (553);

2)	at the end of a sentence ;

3)	tig (Is) into, to, Ικ (ίξ) out of, from, iv in, and is as, when
they follow the words they modify.

552.	The proclitics are :

1)	The forms 6, y, ol, a I of the pronoun (usually called the
“article,” from its use in later Greek, 765, 481).

2)	The prepositions ets (is) into, to, εκ (εξ) out of from, and
iv in, except when they follow the word they modify.

3)	The conjunctions « if, and is as, that (also a preposition to),
except when it means thus, or when it follows its noun.

4)	The adverb ον (ονκ, ονχ) not, except at the end of a sentence.

553.	Enclitics. — An enclitic is a word which regularly loses its
own accent, and is pronounced as if it were a part of the preceding
word, as οΐωνοΐσὶ τ£ and for the birds, where re (re) has lost
its accent, which has become attached to the last syllable of the
preceding word.

554.	The enclitics are :	,	v,/

1)	The personal pronouns 'μεν, μοε, μί, σεν (σεο), σοὶ (τοί), σε, Ιο
(eo), εθεν, όε^ε, σφε(σε), σφίν, σφε, σφάς (σφας), σφεα(s), σφωεν, σφωε,
σφεων, μεν·

2)	The indefinite pronoun τις, τϊ some (one), any (one), something,
anything, in all its forms (but not ασσα = τενα).

<pb n="213"/>555-559]

HOMERIC GREEK

3)	The indefinite adverbs που (ποθί), πη, ποί, ποθίν, ποτέ, πώ, πώς.

Note. — When used as interrogatives, the pronouns τίς, τὶ who f
which ? what ? and the adverbs που (ποθώ), ιτβ, ποΐ, πόθίν, πότε, πω, πώς,
have the accent here given, “which they never lose.

4)	The present indicative of ἀμὶ be, and of φημὶ say (except
Ιάσι, the 3d pi. of ἀμὶ and possibly the second singular φης of
Φημί)·

5)	The particles γέ, τί, τοί, πέρ, νν(ν), κέ(ν), θην, ρά.

6)	The pronominal suffix -δε, the local suffix (“ preposition ”) -δε,
and the adverbial suffix (as cl6c, αϊθί).

555.	An enclitic does not lose its accent in the following cases:

1)	When it is dissyllabic and follows a word which has the
acute on the penult.

2)	When the preceding vowel is elided (575).

3)	When there is no preceding word.

4)	When there is an emphasis on the enclitic.

556.	έστί(ν) is written with an accent on the first syllable (Ιστι)
when:

1)	It comes at the beginning of a sentence or of a verse of
poetry :

2)	It denotes possibility or existence.

3)	It is preceded by ονκ, ἀ, καί, ω,\ μη, ἀλλ’, or τοίτ\

557.	When an enclitic is followed by one or more enclitics in
the same sentence, each except the last receives the acute accent
on its final syllable from the enclitic following.

558.	When a word is compounded with an enclitic, it is
accented as though they were separate, as οὐτε (ον + τί),

(η + δε), οιδε (οΐ + δε), etc.

559.	In the following cases the word before an enclitic keeps
its own accent, and never changes the acute to the grave :

1)	If it has an acute on the antepenult (543), or the circumflex
on the penult (543), it adds an acute on the ultima (543) as a
second accent.

2)	If it has the acute on the penult (543), or the circumflex on
the ultima (543), no change is made.

<pb n="214"/>ENCLITICS, SYLLABLES, ORTHOGRAPHY [560-563

Note. — Remember ih/it two acute accents cannot stand on successive
syllables.

3.	If it is a proclitic or an enclitic, it takes the acute on the
ultima (543).

560.	Syllables. — A Greek word has as many syllables as it has
vowels and diphthongs. In dividing a word into syllables, single
consonants, combinations of consonants which can begin a word,
and a mute (509) followed by μ or v are usually placed at the
beginning of the syllable. Other combinations of consonants are
divided, as ἀν-θρω-ποὶ man, φα-ρί-τρη quiver, μά-χε-σθαι to fight,
l-χω I have, 0ά-λασσα sea, ἀγ-α-μί-μνων Agamemnon. Compound
words are divided according to their original parts, as ένν-ί-ηκε
brought together (a compound of £vv and eque, from ξννίημι = £ΰν

+ ιημι = £νν-ί-^η-μι).

561.	Movable Consonants. — The following words are sometimes
spelled with and sometimes without a final v, called v-movable:

1)	All words (except ίσσί), ending in -σι, including -|i and -ψι.

2)	All verbs of the third person singular ending in -e.

3)	The third singular of the pluperfect ending in -« (originally
-ce, 584, 2 ; 585).

4)	-The verb έστί, and the particles κὶ and vv, all of which are
enclitics.

5)	The dative plural of the personal pronouns αμμι, νμμι, σφί,
σφίσι.

6)	The endings φι and θί, mostly adverbial.

7)	The pronoun έγώ I.

562.	This nu-movable comes regularly in all these words at the
end of a line of poetry and at the end of a sentence, and always
when the end of a verse coincides with the end of a sentence.
Elsewhere the word may be spelled with or without it, according
to the pleasure of the writer or the requirements, of the verse.

563.	Similarly some adverbs had a movable sigma at the end,
as τΓολλώα(ϊ) often, and others ending in -κι(ς), μίσ(σ)ηγν(ν),
ἀτρί)ua(s), ἀντίκρν(ί), Ιθν(ς), μίχοφς), ἀχρι(ϊ), ἀμφί(s), οὐτω(ϊ), iru>(s),
£Κ (i£).

<pb n="215"/>564-572]

HOMERIC GREEK

564.	Variant Spellings. — The following words were spelled at
times with a single sigma, and at times the sigma was doubled :

1)	The future and aorists of verbs with stems (630) ending in
a short vowel, or in a short vowel followed by a consonant.

2)	The ending of the dative plural of the third declension.

3)	The words όσ(σ)θ5, όποσ(σ)ος, όσ(σ)άκι, τόσ(σ)ος, τοσ(σ)άκι,
τόσ(σ)ο8ε, τοσ(σ)οντος, μέσ(σ)ος, πρόσ(σ)ω, πρόσ(σ)οθε(ν), δπίσ(σ)ω,
νεμεσ(σ)άω, νεμεσ(σ)ητός, νέμ.εσ(σ)ίς, and Όδυσ(σ)εΰ5 ill all _its cases.

565.	In the same way, other words were spelled with a single
or a double consonant, as όπ(π)ως, όπ(π)η, ἀχ;λ(λ)ενς, o(t)tl.

566.	Many words begimiing with λ, μ, v, p, and σ are often
spelled with these letters doubled when they are brought before
a short vowel by composition or inflection, as έπέσσνται (επί, σενο-
μαί), έμμορε (μείρομαι), ελἈαβε (λαμβάνω), ερρεε (ρέω), ἀπεν(ν) ίζοντο
(από, νίζω).

Note. — These letters were sometimes doubled in pronunciation,
although it was not represented graphically.

567.	A few words were spelled with or without a final vowel:

1) -i ; ἐν(ί), οΰκ(ί), π(ρ)οτὶ = πρός ;	2)	-α ; ἀν(ά), κατ(ά), παρ((£).

568.	The following words were spelled with and without τ or Θ :

π(τ)όλις, π(τ)όλεμος, μαλ(θ)ακός, 8ι.χ(θ)ά, τρίχ(θ)ά.

569.	The following words were spelled with or without

initial σ :	(σ)κεδάνννμι,	(σ)μίκρός,	σΰς	(vs), συφορβός (νφορβός),

Φελλοὶ (Ελλοί). See 603-604.

570.	Some double forms are : μία (ία) one; γαΐα (γη) earth, land,
country; λείβω (ε’ίβω) drip, drop, pour; ερί(γ)8ονπος loud-roaring,
resounding; £όν, συν together, with.

571.	Variations in Quantity. — Some words have a syllable which
may be either long or short (sometimes, Wt not always, represented
by a difference in spelling), according to the pleasure of the one
using it, as "Ολυμπος (Ονλνμπος), όνομα (ουνομα), κολεόν (κουλεόν),
όρος (ονρος), ἀνηρ (άνηρ), Ἀπόλλων (2Ἀπόλλων), είληλονθα (εληλνθα),
εϊνεκα (ένεκα), μην (μέν), έταρος (εταίρος), ἀτάρ (αντάρ), πολνς (πουλύς).

572.	A diphthong or a long vowel, which precedes another
vowel in the same word, is often shortened in pronunciation,

<pb n="216"/>ORTHOGRAPHY, ELISION

[573-578

as υίός son (A, 499), where the iefer requires the first syllable
to be pronounced short. In the following examples the difference
in pronunciation is indicated by the spelling also :

®ησηα
εστηοτος
*Ἀρηος

νηάς, vrja, νηες, νηων, νηεσσι, νηας

ήνς
ηα,ται
κείαται

*βασιληνς,*Ζψς, etc. (llOUllS in -*ψς)

becomes Θι^σεα
“	εσταότος

“	*Ἀ ρεος

reos, via, νίεs, νέων, νεεσσι,
reas
evs
εαται
«carat

βασιλεύ s, Zetis, etc. (nouns
in -evs)

573.	Metathesis of Quantity. —'do and ηο often become εω by an
exchange (metathesis) of quantity; that is, the long vowel (d, η)
becomes short (e), while the short vowel (o) becomes long (ω).

574.	The accent is not affected by metathesis of quantity, but
remains as it was before the metathesis took place. Thus Τϊηλγμ-
ἀδαο becomes Π^λ^ιάδεω, Βριάρηο^ becomes Bpuxpcos, etc.

575.	Elision. — A short final vowel (very rarely the diphthongs αι
and οι also) is regularly dropped when the next word begins with a
vowel or a diphthong. This is called elision. An apostrophe (’)
marks the omission, as 
στέμματ’ ἔχων (for στέμματα ἔχων) having fillets, 
οἴκαδ’ ἱκέσθαι (οἴκαδε ἱκέσθαι) to arrive home, 
ἐπ' ὤμων (ἐπὶ ὤμων) on his shoulders.

576.	Note. — When a final short vowel, preceded by one or more
vowels in the same word, is elided, only the last vowel is lost, and the
other vowels remain unchanged.

577.	The most frequent occurrences of elision are in :

1)	Words of one syllable ending in -ε, as γέ, δέ, κέ, τέ.

2)	Prepositions and conjunctions of two syllables, as ἀλλά,

ἀμφί, ἐπί, παρά.

3)	Some common adverbs, as μάλα, τάχα, ἅμα, ἔτι, ἔπειτα, εἶτα.

578.	In the following words elision does not usually take place:
1) ἄχρι, μέχρι, περί, πρό, ὅτι, τί and its compounds.

<pb n="217"/>

2)	Monosyllables (except those ending in -ε, and a very few
others), as σά, ῥα, and (rarely) σοί, τοί, μοί.

3)	Words ending in -υ.

579.	Elision occurs also in the formation of compound words,
but then without the apostrophe to mark it, as ἐπευφήμησαν (ἐπὶ
εὐφήμησαν they shouted assent.

580.	When the following word begins with a vowel which was
formerly preceded by a lost consonant, especially ϝ, elision does
not ordinarily take place, as ἐνὶ οἴκῳ (= ἐνὶ ϝοίκῳ in (our) home.

581.	ϝ, a semi-vowel corresponding to Eng. w, was pronounced
at times, and at other times neglected.

582.	A smooth mute (512) brought before a rough breathing
(527) by elision (575) is changed to the cognate rough mute
(511-512). Thus κ before a rough breathing becomes χ, τ becomes
Θ, and π becomes φ, as αἰδεῖσθαὶ θ' ἱερῆα and to reverence the
priest, for αἰδῖΐσθαὶ τε ἱερῆα; ὦχ’ ἑκατόγχειρον καλέσᾱσ’ ές μάκρον
Ὄλυμπον quickly having summoned the hundred-handed (giant) into
lofty Olympus, for ὦκα ἑκατόγχειρον, etc.; ἀφίει he sent (him) away,
for ἀπο-ἵει.

583.	If an accented final syllable of a preposition or a conjunction
is elided (575), the accent of the word is lost with the
elided syllable. Other words so accented throw the accent back

on the preceding syllable, but do not change the acute to the
grave (534, 550).

584.	Contraction. —When one vowel follows another vowel in
the same word, contraction sometimes (but not usually) takes
place. When vowels are thus contracted, the following are the
rules:

1)	Vowels which regularly form diphthongs do so, as a 4-1 = at,
o 4- i = oi, etc.

Note.—Observe that the long vowels ἀ, ἡ, ω, when followed by i
regularly form the improper diphthongs a, y, ω (505).

2)	Two like sounds unite in the common long sound, that is,
two a-sounds (a), two e-sounds (e, η), two i-sounds (i), two

<pb n="218"/>ELISION, CONTRACTION, SYNIZESIS [585-586

o-sounds (ο, ω), or two u-sounds (υ), unite to form the common
long (ά, ἡ, l, ω, ΰ) sounds, except ee becomes a, and oo becomes οὐ.

3)	An o-sound absorbs an abound or an e-sound and becomes
long ο (ω), except to gives tv, while ot becomes ov.

4)	If an abound comes together with an e-sound, the one which
comes first absorbs the other and becomes long (α, -η).

5)	A vowel coming before a diphthong beginning with the
same vowel may be, absorbed, and t may be absorbed before oi.
In other cases a vowel before a diphthong may be contracted
with the first vowel of the diphthong, a following iota becoming
iota subscript (505), and a following υ disappearing.

586.	Somewhat akin to contraction is synizesis, which takes
place when two successive vowels which do not form a diphthong
are pronounced as one syllable for the sake of the meter, as
ΊΙηληίάδΐω of the son of Peleus, where Stu> must be pronounced as
one syllable; 6tol Soitv may the gods grant, where 6toI is also pronounced
as one syllable. Or the two syllables forming synizesis
may come in separate words, as S?) οὐτως thus, pronounced as two
syllables, or as δη αΰ again, pronounced, as one syllable.

<pb n="219"/>587-595]

HOMERIC GREEK

587.	Crasis. — A vowel or a diphthong which ends a word may
he contracted and combined into a single syllable with the vowel
which begins the word following. This is very rare in Homer.
A coronis (’) is usually placed over the syllable contracted, as
ταλλα the other {parts), for τα ἀλλα.

588.	In crasis the first word loses its accent, while the accent
of the second remains, which may change however from the acute
to the circumflex, if the rules of accent require it, because of the
long syllable which arises from it.

589.	When two or more syllables are contracted into one, if
either had an accent before contraction, the contracted syllable
has one.

590.	In the case of the contracted penult (543) or antepenult
(543), the accent follows the regular rules.

591.	A contracted ultima (543) takes the acute accent if it had
the acute before contraction. If the penult (543) had the acute
and is contracted with the ultima, the ultima takes the circumflex.

592.	Syncope is the suppression of a short vowel within a
word, as nWe; why in the world ? for τὶ ποτέ.

593.	Ablaut. — In many words which are closely related occurs
a change (sometimes disappearance) of the vowel, as in Eng. sing,
sang, song, sung. This is known as Ablaut {Vowel Gradation).

594.	Ablaut has strong grades and a weak grade, in the latter
of which the vowel (sometimes) does not appear {disappearing
grade).

595.	The most important grades are :

Stkong	Weak

1)	c, o	'	—, or a

2)	a (usually	η in Homer), ω	a

3)	η, ω	«,	a

4)	ω	ο

5)	οι	ι

6)	(υ, οὐ	υ

Note. — (5) and (6) are really part of (1), being the short vowels t, o
combined with i and υ, forming the diphthongs ci, oi.

<pb n="220"/>ABLAUT, SONANT CONSONANTS [596-598

596.	Examples. — 1) βίλ-os missile, ίκη-βόλ-ος free-shooler, ύπο-βλή-δ^ν

breaking in, shooting in, βάλ-λω shoot, hurl - φίρ-ω bear, βουλη-$όρ-ο; counselbearing,
δί-φρ-os chariot (bearer, carrier), φαρ-ίτμη quiver (arrow-carrier).
2) φη-pt (originally φα-pt, 621) I speak, φω-νί'ω I lift up the voice, speak,
l-φα-το lie spoke. 3) τ/-θη-ρι I pul, place, 6ω-η fine {penally placed upon

Ι-λιιτ-ον 1 left. 6) t-λίί-σοραι I shall come, (Ιλή λουθ-α I have come, ')-λυθ-ον
I came.

597.	Sonant Consonants. — In an earlier stage of the language,
the liquids (λ, p) and μ, v of the nasals were often vocalic
(sonant) ; that is, they were used as vowels in certain combinations.
In this case they are ordinarily written with a small circle

underneath, to distinguish them from the consonantal λ, p, μ, v.

598.	In G-reek as we know the language:

1)	Vocalic λ (λ), becomes consonantal (λ) and a strengthening
vowel is developed either before or after, as ίσταλμαι I am sent,
for an earlier Ιστλμαι; πίμπλαντο were filled, for an earlier πι(μ)-
πλντο; πολύς much, for an earlier πλνς.

2)	Similarly vocalic p (p) becomes consonantal (p), and a

o

strengthening vowel is developed either before or after it, as
KapBtrjy κραΒίτ) (= καρδιά, κραδια, 621) heart, for an earlier κρδιά,
καρτ€.ρόζ, Kparepos strong, harsh, for an earlier κρτ€ρος.

o

3)	Vocalic μ (μ) becomes short a, as in δέκα ten, for an earlier

O

δ«κρ, Ιλϋσα I loosed, for ah earlier έλνσμ.

o	o

4)	Vocalic v (v) also becomes short a, as in the ending -a of the

accusative singular, and the ending -as of the accusative plural,

masculine and feminine, of the third declension, for an earlier -v

• °
and -vs. Compare πόδα (acc. sing.) foot with Lat. pedem, which

is for an earlier ποδν (pedm). It occurs commonly elsewhere, as

dpvarca they protect, for ἀρννται, βαθύς deep, ϊπαθον I suffered, for

earlier βνθνς, έπνθον.

Note. — Occasionally the vocalic nasals μ, v (μ, v) became conso-

O O

nantal (μ, v), with or without the development of a strengthening
vowel, as βένθος depth, πένθος woe, for earlier βνθος, νπθοσ

<pb n="221"/>599-603]

HOMERIC GREEK

599.	In the case of the development of a short strengthening
vowel, two spellings of the same word often arose, or else different
forms of the same stem were used, as κρατερός, καρτεράs strong,
harsh; καροίη, κραΒίη heart; ίβαλον I hurled, ίβλήθην I was

hurled.

600.	Consonantal t. — Many Greek words earlier had a consonantal
(semi-vocalic) i, sounded as i in onion, and written i.
Its loss when following the final consonant of the stem of a word
caused the following changes in spelling :

At = λλ; κι, = σσ; τι, 0ι = σσ (sometimes σ); Βι = ζ between
vowels ; yι = ζ after a vowel; y t = δ after a consonant; m, apt,

opt = aiv, aip, oip ; tw, ept, ivi, ιρι, vvc, vpi = ειν, up, lv, Ip, vv, vp.

601.	Compensative Lengthening. — The loss of one or more consonants
in a word usually occasions the lengthening of the preceding
vowel. This is called compensative lengthening. When it
takes place, a, ι, υ = ἀ, l, ϋ ; e = et; ο = οὐ.

602.	Consonantal υ. — p (vau, digamma) was simply a consonantal
(semi-vocalic) υ (just as w in English usually represents a consonantal
u), and one often becomes the other in Greek, as may be
seen from the declension of such forms as βασιλεύς (*βασιληνς)
king, νηνς ship, and βονς (*βωνς) ox, cow, of which the genitives are
βασιληος, νηός, βοός (for ail earlier βασιλ-ηρος, νηρος, βωρος) (572).
The final υ of the stem (630) of these' words thus first became
p and was then lost.

Note. — In a few words p became υ and remained, as ἀπούρας having
taken away (= ἀπορράς), ανερνσαν they drew up (the heads of the victims)
(= ἀρερνσαν = ἀρρερνσαν = ἀνρερνσαν).

603.	Loss of Sigma. —The rough breathing (527) in Greek often
represents a lost sigma. A sigma between two vowels usually
became the rough breathing (compare the change of intervocalic s
to r in early Latin) and was then lost.

605.	Final Consonants. — The only consonants which can stand		

at the end of a word are v, p, and s (including i and ψ). Other
consonants coming at the end of a word are dropped, as δώμα house
(for διοματ) ; νπόδρα askance, scowlingly (for viτοδρακ) ; ελυε for ελυετ.
Cf. amat, amabat, etc.

606.	έκ (ii) out of, from, and ονκ (οΰχ) not, are apparent exceptions,
but as proclitics (551) they are attached closely to the
following word.

607.	οΰ, ονκ, ονχ not are the Yariant spellings for this word
according as it comes before a consonant, a smooth breathing, or
a rough breathing, respectively. At the end of a sentence, clause,
or verse, the form οΰκὶ is sometimes found.

608.	Consonant Change. — There are certain changes which some
of the consonants undergo, mostly in the nature of assimilation,
that is, a consonant becomes similar to, or the same as the consonant
following (partial, or complete assimilation).

609.	Thus κάππζσον (καπτζσον) I fell has complete assimilation
of the t to the following ?r, while in ίπίμφθην (ΐπίμπθην) I was
conducted, sent, there is only partial assimilation.

610.	The most important of these changes are:

1) A labial (-π-, β, ψ), or a palatal (κ, γ, χ) mute before a dental
(τ, δ, Θ) mute must be of the same order (512).

<pb n="223"/>611-613]

HOMERIC GREEK

2)	A dental (τ, δ, Θ) mute before another dental mute becomes σ.

3)	Before μ a labial mute (π, β, φ) becomes μ, while the palatal
mutes κ and χ regularly become gamma-nasal (508), and a dental
mute (τ, δ, Θ) regularly becomes σ.

4)	Before σ: 
a labial mute (π, β, φ) combines and becomes φ.

a palatal mute (κ, γ, χ) combines and becomes ξ.
a dental mute (τ, δ, Θ) is usually assimilated (608),

becoming σ, and one σ is often dropped, as ποσ(σ)ὶ = ποδσι loith
his feet.

5) μ before a labial mute (π, β, φ) remains unchanged.

6)	v before a labial mute (π, β, φ) becomes μ.

v before a palatal mute (κ, γ, χ) becomes gamma-nasal (508).
v before λ, ρ is assimilated (608), becoming λ, or ρ respectively.

7)	A smooth mute (512) before Θ becomes a rough mute of the
same class (510).

8)	β + v becomes μν ; δ or τ + π becomes ππ ; δ + λ = λλ ; λ
+ ν = λλ; ν + μ = μμ.

9)	τ + ι (when ι is final, or medial followed by another vowel)
usually = σι, πλούσιος (πλοῦτος).

Note. — ντ before final ι becomes νς; the v is then dropped and the
preceding vowel lengthened by compensation, 601, 618.

611. Thus, with the exception of	(out of, from) in composition,
the only combinations of mutes which can occur are πτ, κτ,
/38, γδ, φθ, Χθ, 7τφ, κχ, and τθ.

Νότε. — y before κ, y, χ, ξ is a. nasal (508, 515) and not a mute.

612.	When v is brought before p by inflection (626) or composition,
a δ is developed to assist the pronunciation. Similarly,
when a μ is brought before p (or λ) a β is developed, as ανήρ, ἀν-
8ρός (άνρος) α man, of a man, αμβροτος (ά-μρτος, 597), immortal,
μίμβλιται (μιμλΐται) is a concern. For a similar development in
English compare tender (Lat. tenerum), cinder (Lat. cinerem),
number (Lat. numerum), humble (Lat. humilem).

613.	μ, ν, ντ, νδ, νθ, ρ, λ before σ, and σ before ν are regularly
dropped and the preceding vowel is lengthened by compensation
(601).

<pb n="224"/>CONSONANT CHANGE, PUNCTUATION [614-623

614.	In prepositional compounds, iv before λ, p, or σ remains
unchanged, while συν (ξύν) before σ becomes συσ, and before σ +
a consonant or before ζ becomes συ-.

615.	μ. before σ is dropped and the preceding vowel lengthened,
or else the μ is doubled, as ἀμὶ (ίσμι) I am, ίμμ^ναι (έσμεναι) to be.

616.	Words spelled with an initial p have this letter regularly
doubled when by composition or inflection it comes to stand after
a vowel (not a diphthong).

617.	λ, μ, v, and σ are often doubled under similar conditions
(525, 566).

618.	σ between consonants, except in compounds, is dropped.

619.	If a syllable begins with an aspiration (a rough breathing,
or a rough mute φ, θ, χ), the preceding syllable may not ordinarily
have an aspiration, but becomes smooth, as τίθ-ημι (θιθημι) I put,
place, τρίφια (θρέφω) I nurture, πίφηνα (φΐφηνα) I shone, ίχω (ίχω)
I have. This is known as dissimilation.

Note. — This rule is not always observed in the formation of the
aorist passive, where two rough mutes may begin successive syllables.

620.	Dialects. — The Homeric poems are a mixture of two Greek
dialects, Aeolic and Ionic, the bulk of the forms being Ionic.
Certain apparent irregularities are due to the Aeolic element in
them.

621.	The long alpha (ά) of the earlier language and found in
most of the other Greek dialects regularly becomes ἡ in Ionic
Greek, as βουλή desire, plan (βονλά). Long alpha in the Homeric
poems is regularly due to contraction (584-585), to compensative
lengthening (601), or else is an Aeolic form.

622.	Punctuation. — Greek punctuation differs from English in
having the semicolon and the colon represented by a single dot
above the line (·), while the interrogation mark has the same form
as the English semicolon (;)·

623.	Transliteration. — So many Greek words have come into
English through the medium of the Latin that the system of
transliteration usually employed by the old Bomans is the one
commonly used for the mass of Greek words in our tongue.

<pb n="225"/>624)

HOMERIC GREEK

This in general represented the Greek letters by their corresponding
English equivalents. Those which differ at all were
regularly transliterated as follows :

ζ = z, as ζωον animal (zoology, zoon, epizootic).
k = c, as δέκα ten (decalogue, decagon, decade).
v = y,1 as 7npfire (pyre, pyrotechnie(al), pyrography, pyrolatry).
cu = (a)e, as παΐς (stem παιδ) child (pedagogue, paedobaptism,
paedogenesis).

a = e, i, ei, as χείρ hand (chirography), είδωλον (idol), ΰδός appearance
(kaleidoscope), μονσεάον dwelling of the muses (museum),
ot = (o)e, as οΐκος house, home (economy, ecology), όμοιος like
(hom(o)eopathy, homoeomorphous).
ου = v, as βονς ox, cow (bucolic, Bucephalus, bucentaur,
bucranium).

ευ — eu2 as ἐν well (euphony, eulogy, euphemism).
p = rli, as ρέω flow (rhetoric, rheum(atism), catarrh).
γ-nasal (508)=«., as ἀγγελος messenger (angel(ic, -ology),evangel).
Iota-subscript (505) was usually omitted, as ωδή ode, ®ρήκη
Thrace, ἡ in Homeric Greek, when representing an ὰ in later
(Attic) Greek (621), was often transliterated by a, as "Ἀρη Hera,
Ἀθήνη Athena. This rule applies especially to ἡ when following
e, t, p, or when final.

624.	The following special rules apply to final endings :
oi = i, as 'Ἀχαιοὶ Achaei, Δαναοὶ Danai.

■η = a (sometimes e) (621) : ~2πάρτη Sparta, Ιθάκη Ithaca,
Εκάτη HecatL

ος = US (sometimes os) :	Πάτροκλος	Patroclus,	'Όλνμπος

Olympus; but Ἀήμνος Lemnos, Ἀήλος Delos, etc.
ov = urn, as Sowiov .Sunium, Παλλάδιον Palladium.
tui, τιη — cy: δημοκρατίη democracy,
ιη, La = y, as ἀρκαδίη Arcadia, Arcady, φιλοσοφίη (φιλέω love,
σοφίη skill, wisdom), philosophy, literally = love of
wisdom.

1	Only when standing alone ; never when part of a diphthong.

2	Occasionally = ev in compounds, as εύά^γελοϊ messenger of good (news)
(evangel, evangelist(ic), evangelic(al)).

Present Condition

THE PARTHENON

After serving as a temple for about nine centuries, the Parthenon was turned into a Christian
church, and later into a Mohammedan mosque. In 1687 a.d. the Venetians bombarded Athens
and sent a shell into the center of the building, which the Turks had used as a powder magazine.
The result was an explosion that threw down the side walls and many of the columns.
<pb/>TRANSLITERATION, INFLECTION [625-633

625.	Greek proper names are transliterated according to the
foregoing rules. They are put into the nominative (639), and
are pronounced by ignoring the Greek accent and by accenting
the penult (543) of the word if it is long (522) in Greek, otherwise
the antepenult ( 543), as Ἀητώ Lito, "Ολυμπος Olympus.

II. MORPHOLOGY
INFLECTION

626.	Inflection, including declension (nouns, adjectives, pronouns),
comparison (adjectives, adverbs), and conjugation, is the
fusion of a so-called stem (630), and certain elements which express
relationship to other words.

627.	A root is the essential part of a word which remains after
it has been analyzed into its various parts, and all prefixes, suffixes,
and formative elements have been removed.

628.	A stem often has more than one form, its different forms
usually standing in ablaut (593-595) relation to each other. It
is ordinarily derived from a root, by the addition of various
formative elements, prefixes, and suffixes.

629.	Some roots are also stems, and are combined directly
with inflectional elements.

630.	An inflected word is in general made up of two parts:

1)	The fundamental part, or stem.

2)	The inflectional element (usually an ending, commonly called a
suffix ; sometimes a prefix, as in the case of the augment, 830), which
combines with the stem to form ease, number, tense, person, etc.

631.	The last letter of the stem is called the stem characteristic,
and from this last letter stems are classified as vowel stems, mute
(509) stems, liquid (516) stems, etc.

DECLENSION

Nouns

632.	Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined.

633.	Number. — There are three numbers in Greek, the singular
denoting one, the dual denoting two (usually referring to a pair of

<pb n="227"/>

objects closely associated, or belonging together by nature and
forming a closely related, unified group, as χεῖρε, ὀφθαλμώ, ἵππω the
two hands, eyes, horses. Compare yoke, team, pair in English),
and the plural denoting more than two.

Note. — The plural is often used interchangeably with the dual to
denote only two.

634.	Gender. — There are three genders, the masculine,
feminine, and neuter.

635.	The gender must usually he learned by observation, hut
in general:

1)	The names of males are masculine.

2)	The names of females are feminine.

3)	The names of rivers, winds, and months are usually masculine.

4)	The names of countries, towns, trees, and islands are usually

feminine.

5)	Most nouns denoting qualities and conditions are feminine.

636.	A few nouns are used either as masculine or feminine, as
παῖς child, which may be of either gender, and may mean either
hoy or girl, as may be required by occasion. Such words are said
to be of common gender.

637.	The demonstrative (often relative, or personal) pronoun
most extensively used in the Homeric poems is ὁ, ἡ, τό, the first
form being masculine, the second feminine, and the third neuter.

638.	The form of the noun which appears in the vocabulary is
the nominative singular, unless otherwise indicated. This is followed
by the ending of the genitive singular<n>grc:I think we should change this and show the whole form -- more space but more explicit</n>, which denotes to
which declension the noun belongs. After the ending of the genitive
singular is placed the appropriate form of this,, pronoun, to
indicate the gender. Thus θεός, θεοῦ, ὁ god is second declension
masculine; βουλἠ, βουλῆς, ἡ wish, will, plan is first declension feminine,
and ἄλγος, ἄλγεος, τό pain, woe is third declension neuter.

639.	Cases. — There are five cases in Greek, the nominative,
genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative, together with remnants
of three lost cases, the locative, instrumental, and ablative (657).

<pb n="228"/>

640.	All these cases except the nominative and vocative are
called oblique cases.

641.	Accent of Nouns. — The accent of a noun usually remains
in all the forms on the same syllable as in the nominative singular,
or at least as near that syllable as the general rules of accent will
allow. Thus ἥρως (nominative singular), but ἡρώων of heroes
(genitive plural). See 544 ff.

642.	Words monosyllabic in the nominative singular, when
becoming dissyllabic by declension, regularly have the accent on
the final syllable in all the dissyllabic forms of the genitive and
dative of all numbers, but keep the accent on the first syllable in
all other cases.

643.	An accented ultima in general takes the acute, but in the
genitive and dative of all numbers a long ultima, if accented,
takes the circumflex, as ψύχη soul (nom. sing.), but ψνχῆς of a soul
(gen. sing.), ψνχῃ to, for a soul (dat. sing.), etc.

644.	Declensions. —Nouns are declined in two general ways:

1)	The vowel declension, for stems (628) ending in the open
vowels, ᾱ, ο.

2)	The consonant declension, for stem's ending in a consonant,
or the closed vowels, i, v.

645.	The vowel declension has two forms, according as the
noun stem ends in d or o. Hence we have:

1)	The α declension, commonly called the first declension;

2)	The ο declension, commonly called the second declension.

646.	The consonant declension, for stems ending in a closed
vowel (ι, υ, which were at times semi-consonantal) or a consonant,
is commonly called the third declension.

647.	Words of the first declension have stems ending in ᾱ,
which either becomes shortened in the nominative singular to ᾰ,
or else becomes η (621), except in the one word θεἀ goddess, and a
very few proper names. Nouns of the first declension are either
masculine or feminine.

648.	Case Endings. — To form the various cases, numbers, and
genders, the following case endings were fused with the stems
of substantives and adjectives :

650.	Observe that the dative singular of all declensions ends
in ι, which always becomes iota subscript (505) after long vowels
(584, 1, note).

651.	The dative plural regularly ends in σι, to which may be
added nu-movable (561, 1).

652.	-ῃσι and -οισι are the regular forms for the ending of the
dative plural in the first two declensions. Occasionally the
shorter forms, -ῃς, -οις, are found, hut this is almost always before
vowels, and it is possible that in that case they should be treated
as examples of elision (575) and written -ῃσ' and -οισ’.

653.	The genitive plural of all forms ends in -ων.

1 See footnote 7 on page 230.

<pb n="231"/>

654.	There are but two forms of the dual in each declension,
one (masc. only) for the nominative, accusative, and vocative;
the other for the genitive and dative.

Note. — The form of the gen. and dat. dual of the first declension is
uncertain. Instead of -ῃιν, some read -αιιν (-αιν)

655.	As in Latin, the vocative singular is often like the nominative,
and the vocative plural of all forms is always like the
nominative plural.

656.	The nominative, accusative, and vocative of all neuters are
alike, and in the plural end in short -α.

657.	In an earlier stage of the language there were three other
cases: the instrumental, denoting instrument, means, manner,
etc., the locative, denoting the place where, and the ablative, denoting
separation, source, etc. There are only remnants of these
left in Greek, as the dative became fused with the instrumental
and locative, taking over most of their uses, while the genitive
absorbed most of the functions of the ablative.

658.	In addition to the endings given in the tables (648-649),
two other suffixes, -φι(ν) and -θεν, were sometimes used. For
their uses, see 712, 715.

regularly in Homeric Greek with the meaning of the English
article, either definite (the) or indefinite (a, an). One decides
from the context whether or not the English article is to be
employed in translation.

661.	Meanings of Cases. — The variety of meaning found in the
genitive and dative is due to the fact that each represents the
fusion of two or more earlier cases (657). An attempt is made
to represent this above by the use of semicolons to separate
meanings which once belonged to different cases.

665.	Observe that the original d of the stem of first declension
nouns commonly becomes ἡ throughout the singular (621). It
rarely remains ὰ (in θζα goddess, and a few proper names).

<pb n="234"/>NOUNS, SECOND DECLENSION

[666-676

666.	In some feminines the ὰ of the stem becomes ὰ in the
nominative, which is found also in the accusative and vocative,
but. in the genitive and dative singular the d of the stem becomes
17, just as in nouns ending in ἡ in the nominative singular.

667.	The masculines usually take the case-ending -s in the nominative
singular ; the feminines do not.

668.	The nominative singular of a few masculines ends in -a.;
a very few end in -ds, but most end in -ης.' Those ending in -ά,
excepting those with variant forms in -ψ, regularly have the recessive
accent (548), hnd all are adjectival except the proper name

Θυεστα ThyGStGS.

669.	Masculines and feminines of the first declension are all
declined alike in the dual and plural.

670.	Masculines ending in -ψ and -as in the nominative singular
retain this ἡ or d throughout the singular, with the exception
that the genitive singular always has either the ending -do (regular)
or -εω (rare).

671.	Those ending in -d in the nominative have the same form
also in the vocative singular, but otherwise are declined like those
ending ih -77s.

672.	Feminines ending in -η or -d in the nominative singular
retain this throughout the singular.

673.	Those ending in -d retain this only in the nominative, accusative,
and vocative: the genitive and dative are declined the
same as those ending in -η.

674.	Masculines are declined like feminines except in the nominative
and genitive singular, and occasionally in the vocative singular.

675.	Masculines ending in -817s have -17 in the vocative singular ;
those ending in -της [-τα], compound nouns, and names of national-'
ities have -a ; those ending in -ds have -d.

The Second Declension

676.	Nouns of the second declension have stems ending in -0
(-ε in the voc. sing. m. and f., which stands in ahlaut relation (593-
595) to the -0). They are chiefly masculine and neuter, with a

<pb n="235"/>677-679]

HOMERIC GREEK

very few feminines. The masculines and feminines end in -s in
the nominative singular, the neuters in -v. These when combined
with -o of the stem give the endings os for the masculines and
feminines and -ov for neuters.

677.	The masculines and feminines are declined alike; the
neuters differ from them in two respects :

1)	The nominative, accusative, and vocative singular all end in

(i.e. -ov).

2)	The nominative,. accusative, and vocative plural end in -a.

The Third Declension

680.	Nouns of the third declension are masculine, feminine,
and neuter.

681.	There are many forms of the nominative of third declension
nouns, which must be learned partly by practice, but in general
:

1) Masculine and feminine stems, except those ending in v, p,
and σ, add σ to the stem and make the usual euphonic changes

2)	Masculine and feminine stems ending in p, σ and most of
those ending in v make no change except to lengthen the last
vowel if it is short.

3)	Stems ending in v(t) either make no change except to
lengthen the last vowel if it is short, dropping final τ wherever
it occurs, or else they add σ to the stem and make the usual
euphonic changes (613), loss of v(t) and lengthening of the preceding
vowel. Thus the stems : δαιρ,ον-, θϊν-, ρ,ελαν-, γεροντ- give the
nominatives δαιρ,ων divinity, Ois shore, beach, μιλάς black and γέρων
old man, respectively.

682.	In neuters the nominative singular is usually the stem,
with the exception of those with stems ending in τ which is
dropped wherever it occurs.

683.	As a rule the stem of third declension nouns may be found
by dropping the case ending (-os) of the genitive singular.

684.	The dative singular regularly ends in i, but occasionally
in ϊ.

685.	The accusative singular of masculine and feminine nouns
is regularly formed by adding v to stems ending in vowels and by
adding v (597) to consonantal stems, v of course regularly becomes
-ὰ (598, 4), thus making the case ending of accusatives sin-

(613). .

<pb n="237"/>686-693]

HOMERIC GREEK

gular masculine and feminine regularly -v for vowel stems and -a
for consonantal steins.

686.	The dative plural is formed in two ways :

1)	By adding -εσσι (rarely -εσι) to the stem.

2)	By adding -σι (rarely -σσι) to the stem.

687.	Note.— When -σι [-σσι] is added, the preceding consonants are
assimilated, or dropped, according to the rules (613 f£.). Thus του?, πο-
δός, ο fool gives ποσσὶ (from ^Γοδ-σι), which maybe further simplified to
ποσι; νΰ£, ννκτός, -η night gives νυ£ι (from ννκτ-σι) ; γέρων, γεροντο?, ὁ old
man, gives γερονσι (from γερονν-σι), etc. The longer forms of the datives
of these nouns are πόδεσσι, ννκτεσσι, -γερόντεσσι.

688.	The accusative plural of masculines and feminines originally
ended in -ys (-vs), which gives the ending -as (598,4) for consonant
stems, and -ts, -is (613 ff.) as the regular ending for the
vowel stems.

689.	Note. — A few vowel stems seem to have had -as in the accusative
plural, formed by analogy from the consonantal stems.

690.	Words ending in -ts and -vs in the nominative singular,
but with dental mute (τ, δ, θ') stems very rarely drop the mute
and take the accusative ending (-v) of vowel stems.

691.	The vocative singular is either the same as the nominative,
or else the same as the stem, final consonants except v, p, ?
(605) being dropped whenever they occur.

692.	Compensative lengthening (601) regularly takes place in
the formation of the dative plural when vr is thus dropped, but
does not take place when only one letter, as τ, δ, θ, σ, v, is dropped ;
as πασι (παντ-σι), γερουσι (γεροντ-σι), δαίμοσι (δαιρ.ον-σι).

others with genitives in -ατο? are neuter.

<pb n="243"/>711-718]

HOMERIC GREEK

Stray Case Forms

711.	The old ending -θι may be added to the stem of a noun
or a pronoun to indicate place where.

712.	The ending -θεν may be added to the stem of a noun or a
pronoun to indicate source or separation, or to express various
other relations of the genitive, as ονρανόθεν from heaven, σίθεν of
you.

713.	-Sc, a postpositive (15, 3) enclitic (553; 554, 6), with the
force of a preposition (as, cs, cVi), may be added to the accusative
to denote place to which, or limit of motion, as ἀγορηνε to the
assembly.

714.	The ending -i may be added to the stem of a noun to denote
place where, or in which (the locative, 657), as οίκοι at home.

715.	The ending -φι(ν), added to the stem of a noun or pronoun,
is used to express various relations, both singular and
plural, of both genitive and dative (especially -when used in the
instrumental sense).

716.	Irregular Nouns. — There are various types of irregularity
in the formation and declension of nouns; the gender in the
plural may be different from that in the singular; -words may be
declined from two separate stems (heteroclites), but have the
same nominative singular; they may have cases formed from
another stem than the nominative singular (metaplastic forms) ;
or they may be used in only one case, or part of the cases (defectives).
Irregular nouns can best be learned from the lexicon,
as one meets them in reading and has occasion to use them.
Most of them are very rare.

Adjectives

717.	Adjectives have three declensions, as nouns, and follow
the same general rules.

718.	With respect to form they may be divided into four
classes:

1)	Adjectives of the first and second (vowel) declensions.

2)	Adjectives of the second declension (mostly compounds).

<pb n="244"/>ADJECTIVES, FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS [719-721

3)	Adjectives of the first and third declensions.

4)	Adjectives of the third (consonant) declension.

719.	The form of the adjective which appears in the vocabulary
is the nominative singular of all genders (except in the case
of a very few of only one gender, in which case the nominative
and genitive singular are given).

720.	Adjectives of the first and second declensions have three
endings (ος, η, ον) in the nominative singular, for the three
genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter, respectively.

Note. — Superlatives (as ἄριστος, ἀρίστη, ἄριστον), participles in ος, η, ον and
all words that have these three endings in the nominative singular are
similarly declined.

722.	The feminine of adjectives of the first and second declensions
regularly ends in -η, and is declined as above ; a few end in
the -α, as δῖος, δῖα, δῖον, and are declined as θάλασσα (663).

723.	Adjectives of the second declension have only two endings
(ος, ον), of which the first is both masculine and feminine,
the second neuter. Most of these adjectives are compounds.

724.	The masculine form of many adjectives is often used for
both masculine and feminine, even in the case of those which
have separate forms for the feminine.

725. Adjectives of the first and third declensions have a separate
form for the feminine, which is declined like a noun in -α
(θάλασσα, 663) of the first declension.

726. The masculine and neuter of adjectives with stems in
-ν-, -if- are declined like πη-χυ% and ἀστυ respectively (704).

Declension of Participles

735.	All middle and. passive participles, except those of the
first and second aorist passive, are declined like κᾱλός, ή, όν (721).

736.	All active participles (except the perfect, 744) and both

nominative.

738.	Participles with stems in ovr usually have the nominative
singular masculine in -w, as γέρων 693.

. 739. But the present and second aorist of -μι verbs (διόονς, Sou's),
and all stems ending in avr, tvr, wt, add s, lose vt (613), and
lengthen the preceding vowel (giving ous, as, as, us 601). The

Note 1.	— λελνκώς,	υΓα, os does not occur in Homer,	and there are
very few first perfects		in Homeric Greek. The forms of the first per-	
feet participle, as given		above are common in later Greek.	
Note 2.	— Perfect participles are often declined with		: ω instead of ο
throughout; and at times end in -ων, -ουσα, -ον and are			inflected with
the same endings as the present participle.			
745. Participles of contract verbs, 936-944 (usually left uncon-

746.	The participles of -οω contract verbs (as χολόω anger) end
in -ών, οΐσα, ovv (as χολών, χολοΐσά, χολοίν) in the nominative singular,
and are quite regular in their declension, the genitive being
χολοΐντοϊ, χολοΰσης, χολοΐψτος; the dative being χολονντι, χολονσrj,

χολονντι, etc.

Comparison of Adjectives

747.	Most adjectives form their comparatives by adding -repos,
rj, ov, and their superlatives by adding -raros, ἡ, ον to the stem of
the masculine positive.

74S. If the penult of the stem is long by nature or position
(522), the stem for the comparative and superlative remains unchanged.
If it is short, it is regularly lengthened, o becoming ■>.

749.	Examples

Positive	Comparative	Superlative

πιστόϊ (πιστο ) faithful, trustworthy TTLCTTOTEpos	ιτιστότατοϊ

μαλακοὶ (μαλακό-) soft, gentle	μαλακώτίροί	μαλακώτατοϊ

750.	The declension of comparatives and superlatives is usually
the regular vowel declension of adjectives, as κᾱλός, ή, όν (721).

<pb n="255"/>751^55]

HOMERIC GREEK

751.	Some adjectives, mainly those in -us and -pos, form the
comparative and superlative by changing these endings to -ιων,
-ιον for the comparative, and to -ιστ-os, y, ov for the superlative.

752.	Examples

Positive	Comparative	Superlative

ήδός sweet	ήδίων, ήδιον sweeter	ήδκπος, ἡ, ov sweetest

αίσχρός shameful αἰσχίων, ιον more shameful αϊσχκπος, ἡ, ov most

shameful

753.	The comparative of these adjectives is.declined like ἀμ,ΰ-
νων, ον (731), and the superlative like κᾱλός, ή, όν (721).

754.	The most important cases of irregular comparison are :

Positive
1) αγαθός good, brave,
noble

κρατνς ( κραταιός, ή,

761.	The nominative singular of the personal pronouns is used
only for the sake of emphasis and contrast, being omitted under
other conditions.

762.	The oblique cases of these pronouns are enclitic (553),
but if the pronoun is emphatic these cases keep their accent, and
the longer forms of the first person are then used. This happens
as a rule after prepositions. The forms without accent in the
above table are enclitic.

763.	The pronoun of the third person is sometimes used as a
reflexive, that is, it refers to the subject of the leading verb of
the sentence.

764.	The possessive pronouns are formed from the stems of
the personal pronouns and are declined like adjectives of the
vowel declension, i.e. like κᾱλός, κᾱλή, κᾱλόν  (721).

Note. — The dative plural of όδε, r)8e, toSe at times has τοίσ8οσ(σ)ι
instead of τοΐσ (i)8c.

775.	Compounds of ό, r/, τό (as 68ί, y8e, τό8ο; oyr, ήγο, roye) are
declined the same as the simple form (ό, ή, τδ) with the additional
part (-y«, -Se, etc.) attached. As these are compounds,
formed of the simple pronouns and the enclitics, they are accented
the same as the simple forms without the enclitics (553, 558).

776.	The indefinite relative pronoun (όστι?, rf-rts, on) whoever,
whichever, whatever, is a compound of the simple relative (ό?, ή, ο)
and the indefinite rU, rl, each part of which is declined separately
(or sometimes only the latter part).

HOMERIC GREEK

777.	Z τι, the neuter of the indefinite relative pronoun, is thus
printed in most texts, that it may not be confused with the conjunction,
otl that, because, ivhy.

779.	This pronoun is used only in the genitive, dative, and
accusative.

Adverbs

780.	Most Greek adverbs are of twofold origin :

1)	Isolated case-forms of nouns, pronouns,, and adjectives,
which became crystallized and used in an adverbial connection.

2)	Adverbs formed by means of various suffixes (630), of which
the origin is unknown.

781.	The most common occurrence of the use of various cases
of the noun, pronoun, and adjective adverbially is the employment
of the neuter accusative of the adjective, singular or plural,
with or without the pronoun τό, τά, as an adverb. The neuter of
nouns and pronouns is sometimes, but less commonly, used in
the same way.

782.	A great number of adverbs end either in -ω or in -ως.

783.	Those ending in -ως are adverbs of manner, and are
formed from adjectives and pronouns. They have the accent of
the genitive plural neuter of the word from which they are
formed.

784.	For the comparative of these abverbs, the neuter accusative
singular of the comparative of the adjective is used, and for
the superlative the neuter accusative plural of the superlative of
the adjective.

785.	Adverbs of place which end in -ω (and a few others) form
the comparative by adding -τέρω, and the superlative by adding
-τάτω to the stem (628).

786.	The prepositions were originally adverbs, and most of
them are still so used in Homer.

787.	Examples	of	Formation

ADJECTIVE	STEM	GENITIVE PLURAL	ADVERB
κᾱλός, κᾱλή, κᾱλόν	κᾱλο-	κᾱλῶν	κᾱλῶς
κακός, κακή, κακόν	κακο-	κακῶν	κακῶς
ἄλλος, ἄλλη, ἄλλο	ἀλλο-	ἄλλων	ἄλλως

788.	The most important suffixes (630) used in the formation
of adverbs (780, 2) are:

1)	-ι, -σι, -θι, -ου, denoting place where.

2)	-θα, -θε(ν), denoting place where.

3)	-θεν, denoting place whence.

4)	-δε (originally an enclitic preposition = English to), denoting whither.

5)	-σε, denoting whither.

6)	-τε, denoting time.

7)	-τος, denoting where.

8)	-κα (origin unknown), as in αὐτί-κα.

9)	-κας (origin unknown), as in ἑ-κάς.

10)	-κις (with generalizing, indefinite meaning; akin to τὶς, τὶ), as πολλά-κις many a time, often.

11)	Some other endings are -α, -δην, -δον, -τι, -στι.

Verbs

789.	Verbs, as well as all other inflected (626-630) forms, consist
of two principal elements :

1)	the stem;

2)	the ending, or suffix.

<pb n="265"/>

790.	Often more than one suffix is fused with a verb stem, to
indicate its various relations of mode, tense, voice, person, number,
etc., as λύ-ο-μεν, λύ-ε-τε (from λύ-ω loose), where the primary stem
of the verb is λυ-, to which the suffixes are attached.

791.	The forms of a Greek verb fall into two main classes :

1)	Finite (indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative).

2)	Infinite (infinitive and participle).

792.	The characteristics of the finite forms are the personal
endings, augment, reduplication, voice, mode, and tense signs, etc.

793.	The participle is a verbal adjective, and is used as other
adjectives.

794.	The infinitive is a verbal noun, formerly used in several

cases, but restricted in Greek to old case-forms of the dative and
locative.	

795.	Thematic and Athematic forms.—With respect to form
Greek verbs fall into two main classes :

1)	-ω verbs, i.e. those ending in -ω in the first person singular,
present active indicative, sometimes called thematic verbs (796).

2)	-μι verbs, i.e. those ending in -μι in the first person singular,
present active indicative, sometimes called athematic verbs (797).

796.	The thematic verbs are so named because in a majority
of their forms the personal ending (819-821) is preceded by ο/ε
(ο before μ or ν, or in the optative mode, otherwise ε), which is
called the thematic vowel. Thus, λυε/ο- (λύω) is called the theme,
to which the personal endings (819-821) are attached.

797.	Athematic verbs do not have this connecting vowel, but the
personal endings are attached directly to the stem of the verb.

798.	Many verbs which are regularly thematic may have
athematic forms, as δέχθαι, δέκτο (δέχομαι) ; λύμην, λύτο (λύω) ; ἇλτο
(ἅλλομαι), etc.

799.	In the subjunctive these thematic vowels, ο/ε, are regularly
long, being ω/η respectively.

800.	In some cases the thematic vowel is short in the subjunctive,
particularly in the dual and plural of the present and second

<pb n="266"/>

aorist of -μι verbs, the first aorist and second perfect of all verbs,
and the second aorist of all verbs having athematic second aorists
in the indicative.

801.	Strictly speaking no Greek verb is thematic or athematic
throughout; but certain of their forms are inflected thematically
and others athematically.

802.	Those inflected thematically are : all futures ; all presents
and imperfects of -ω verbs (thematic presents); all second aorists
having the thematic vowel (ending in -ον in the first person
singular, active indicative, 865); all subjunctives.

803.	The athematic forms are : the presents and imperfects in
all voices of -μι (athematic) verbs; all aorists passive (except the
subjunctive farms); all middle and passive perfects and pluperfects
; all second aorists whose tense stem does not end in the
thematic vowel (796); a few verbs (as ἵστημι) in the second
perfect and pluperfect, active; all first aorists, active and middle.
The perfects and pluperfects active are primarily athematic in
their inflection.

804.	In the thematic inflection the tense stem varies, ο/ε, as
indicated above.

805.	In the athematic inflection the final vowel of the tense
stem is usually long (lengthened grade) in the singular, and
commonly (but not always) is short (standing in ablaut relation
(593-595), weakened or disappearing grade) in the dual and
plural. This is particularly true of athematic presents and imperfects,
second aorists, perfects, and pluperfects active.

806.	Voices and Modes. — The Greek verb has three voices:
active, middle, and passive. Each voice has six modes: the indicative,
subjunctive, optative, imperative, infinitive, and participial.

807.	Tense systems. — The Greek verb has the following nine
systems of tenses :

1)	present, consisting of the present and imperfect.

2)	future, consisting of the future.

3)	first aorist, consisting of the first aorist, active and middle.

4)	second aorist, consisting of the second aorist, active and
middle.

<pb n="267"/>

5)	first perfect, consisting of the first perfect and pluperfect
active.

6)	second perfect, consisting of the second perfect and pluperfect
active.

7)	perfect middle, consisting of the perfect, pluperfect, and
future perfect middle (passive).

8)	first passive, consisting of the first aorist passive.

9)	second passive, consisting of the second aorist passive.

808.	Each of these systems has a stem, called the <term>tense stem</term>,
to which are added certain endings to denote person and number.

809.	Tense Suffixes. — The suffixes (630) by which the various
tense stems are formed from the verb stem are as follows:

1)	present: a) thematic ε/ο (ο before μ or v, or in the optative,
otherwise ε), as λύ~ο-μεν, λύ-ε-τε; b) athematic none, as φά-μεν,
φά-τε.

2)	future: a) σ(σ)ε/ο  (same rule as the present for ε/ο  ; σ after
long vowels or diphthongs; either σ or σσ after short vowels),
as λύ-σο-μεν, καλέσσ-ο-μεν.

b) εσ ε/ο in liquid and nasal stems (514-516), and σ regularly
dropped (603), as βαλ-έ-ω, φαν-έ-ω ; exceptions κέλ-σω, κέρ-σω,
ὄρ-σω.	

3)	first aorist σ(σ)α (σ after long vowels or diphthongs; either
σ or σσ after short vowels);

b)	σε/ο in a few cases.

c)	σ is usually lost in liquid and nasal verbs, and the preceding
vowel lengthened by compensation (601), as ἔ-μειν-α., ἔ-φην-α, for ἔμενσα, ἔφανσα.

Exceptions to c) : ἔ-κελ-σα, ἔ-κυρ-σα, ὦρ-σα.

4)	second aorist: a) thematic ε/ο, as ἐ-λίπ-o-μεν, ἐ-λίπ-ε-τε.

b) athematic none, as ἔ-βην, ἔ-στη-ν, ἔ-δῡ-τε, ἔ-γνω-ν.

5)	first perfect κα, pluperfect κε, as βέ-βη-κα, έ-βέβή-κε-α (-η)·

6)	second perfect α, pluperfect ε, as πέ-ποιθ-α, ἐ-πε-ποίθ-ε-α (-η), or
none, as ἕ-στα-μεν, ἕ-στα-τε.

7)	perfect middle none, as λέ-λυ-μαι; future perfect σ(σ)ε/ο.

8)	first passive θ η/ε, as ἐ-λύ-θημεν, ἔ-λυ-θε-ν.

9)	second passive η/e, as ἐ-δάμ-η-μεν, ἔ-δαμ-ε-ν.

<pb n="268"/>

810.	Principal Parts. — The principal parts of a verb are the
first person singular of each tense system found in it.

811.	No verb has all the tense systems entire. Most verbs
have no more than six: the present, future, first aorist, first (or
second) perfect active, perfect middle (passive), and the first or
second aorist passive. If the verb does not have a future active,
the future middle (passive) is given. If the verb has a second
aorist, it is added.

812.	Of deponent verbs (897) the principal parts are: the present,
future, perfect, and aorist. This includes both first and
second aorists, middle and passive, if they occur.

813.	Mode Suffix. — Observe that the optative has also the mode
suffix ῑ/ιη, which contracts with the final vowel of the tense stem,
as λύοιμι for λύ-o-ῑ-μι. ἰσταίην for ἱ-στα-ιη-ν.

814.	Tenses. — Of the tenses, seven are found in the indicative
mode: the present, imperfect, aorist, future, perfect, pluperfect,
and future perfect.

815.	The other modes have the present, aorist, and perfect
tenses; the infinitive and participle have in addition the future
tense. 

816.	The tenses of the indicative are distinguished as:

1)	principal (primary) tenses : the present, future, perfect, 
and future perfect.

2)	past (secondary) tenses: imperfect, aorist, and pluperfect
(historical tenses).

817.	The passive has a distinct form only in the aorist;<note>Two second future forms (δαήσεαι, μιγήσεσθαι) are found.</note> in
the other tenses the middle form has both the middle and passive
meaning.

818.	Number and Person.—There are three numbers (singular,
dual, plural) of the Greek verb, as in nouns, and three persons
(first, second, third).

819.	Endings. — Certain suffixes, called personal endings, are
attached to the tense stems of the various finite (791) modes, and



<pb n="269"/>

other endings are attached to the infinitives and participles, to
make the complete verbal forms.

820.	Some of these personal endings have undergone considerable
changes.

821.	In their earlier form they were as follows:

822.	Observe that the subjunctive has the. same endings
throughout as the primary tenses of the indicative, while the

<pb n="270"/>

optative (except at times in the first singular, when it ends in -μι),
has the same endings as the secondary tenses of the indicative.

823.	The first and second aorists passive have the same endings
as the secondary tenses of the active voice.

824.	Primary Endings or the Active Voice (Indicative and Subjunctive)

1	sing.: -μι is found in the present indicative of all -μι verbs,
and in a few subjunctives of -ω verbs, -ω is found in the present
indicative of all -ω verbs, in all futures, and in the subjunctive.
In the perfect indicative there is no personal ending, -α taking the
place of the thematic vowel.

2	sing.: -σι is found only in ἐσσί you are; elsewhere -ς has taken
its place, -θα (-σθα) is used at times in the perfect, imperfect
and pluperfect of the indicative, and occasionally in the subjunctive
and optative.

3	sing.: -τι is found only in ἐστί he is. It becomes -σι in the
other -μι verbs, and -σι is occasionally found in the subjunctive of
-ω verbs, -ω verbs have another ending, of which the origin is
uncertain. The perfect, -ε, has no personal ending.

3 plur.: -ντι regularly becomes -νσι, and ν is then lost, with
lengthening of the preceding vowel (613). Many -μι verbs seem
to have ended in -αντι, which first became -ανσι, and then -ᾱσι (612).
The perfect of consonant stems ended in -ντι (-νσι) which became
-v0τι (-ν0σι) and then -ασι (597-8). Generally -ασι in both present and
perfect has been replaced by -ᾱσι.

825.	Secondary Endings of the Active (Indicative and Optative)

1	sing.: -ν after vowels remained unchanged; after consonants
it became -v0, and then -α (597-8). Pluperfect -εα is usually contracted
to -η. The optative has -ν when the mode suffix is -ιη-
(813); otherwise it has -μι.

3 sing.: -τ is always dropped (605); ἔλυε from ἐλυετ; cf. amat;
ίλνσε has no personal ending; it takes its -e from the perfect.

2	dual: -την sometimes occurs instead of -τον.

3	dual: -τον sometimes occurs instead of -την.

<pb n="271"/>

3 plur.: -v is for an earlier -ντ, t being lost (605), the vowel
before it being regularly short, -σαν, from the first aorist ending,
is used in the imperfect, and often in the second aorist of -μι verbs,
at times in the aorist passive, in the pluperfect active, and in the
optative when it has the mode suffix -ιη-.

826.	Middle Endings, Primary and Secondary (Indicative, Subjunctive, and Optative)

2	sing.: -σαι drops its σ between vowels (603), except in the
perfect, and in the present indicative of -μι verbs.

2	sing, (secondary): -σο regularly drops its σ between vowels
(603), except in the pluperfect, and in the imperfect of -μι verbs.
In a few cases σ is dropped in the pluperfect.

Dual: the first dual -μεθον is rare ; -σθον occurs once instead of
-σθην.

3	plur.: -νται, -ντο regularly become -αται, -ατο (-νται, -ντο) in the
perfect and pluperfect of verbs with consonant stems, stems ending
in -ι, occasionally in vowel stems, and always in the optative.
Elsewhere occasionally -νται, -ντο become -αται, -ατο (597-8).

827.	Endings of this Imperative

2 sing, active: -ε of the second sing, is the thematic vowel, and
forms like λύε, ἄειδε have no personal ending.
-θι is common, with both an active and passive
meaning. In the first aorist passive -θι becomes -τι after -θη- of the passive stem (619).
-ς occurs in a few cases. The endings of the
aorist, -σον (active) and -σαι (middle) are
obscure.

2 sing, middle: -σο loses its σ between vowels (603), except in
the perfect of all verbs and the pres, of -μι
verbs.

Endings of the Infinitives, Participles, and Verbal
Adjectives

828.	Infinitives have the following endings :

1) dative (794) : -αι (-ναι, -μεναι, -εναι, -σαι active ; and -σθαι, -θαι
middle and passive).

<pb n="272"/>

2) locative (794): -εν, -μεν (following the thematic vowel ε, ε-εν
regularly contracts to -ειν, 584-5).

829.	Participles have the following endings added to the tense
stem:

1)	-ντ- for all active tenses, except the perfect (usually), and the
first and'second aorists passive.

2)	-οτ- (-Ϝοτ-), occasionally -οντ- in the perfect active.

3)	-μενο- (feminine -μενᾱ.-) in the middle; and in the passive,
except the aorist passive.

Note. — Verbal adjectives end.in-τός, and are usually equivalent
to passive (sometimes active) participles in meaning, or else denote
possibility, as -γνωτός [γιγνώσκω] known, ποιητός [ποιέω] made, τυκτός
[τεύχω] made. They are formed by adding the ending tos to the verb
stem, usually as it appears in the first or second aorist passive.

830.	Augment. — Greek verbs prefix an augment (increase) at
the beginning of the secondary (816) tenses of the indicative,
to denote past time.

831.	This augment is of two kinds :

1)	syllabic augment, which prefixes ἐ- to verbs beginning with a
consonant, as λύω I loose, imperfect ἔλυον I was loosing.

2)	temporal augment, which lengthens the first syllable of words
beginning with a vowel or a diphthong, ἀκούω I hear, ἤκουον
I was hearing.

832.	When augmented α, ε regularly become η; ι, o, υ become ῑ,
ω, ῡ respectively; αι and ᾳ become ῃ; while οι becomes ῳ.

833.	Of course η, ῃ, ῑ, ῡ, ω, and ῳ do not undergo any change
when augmented.

834.	Verbs beginning with ρ regularly double it after the
augment. Those beginning with λ, μ, v, or σ sometimes double
the initial consonant after the augment.

835.	Verbs beginning with a vowel formerly preceded by a lost
consonant (usually p, or σ), may take the syllabic instead of the
temporal augment, as ἑανδάνω, imperfect of ἁνδάνω (σϜανδάνω)
please.

836.	When initial σ has thus been lost, the augment always

<pb n="273"/>

contracts with the first vowel of the stem, according to the rules
(584-5); when initial Ϝ has been lost, contraction may or may not
take place. Thus ἔχω (σεχω), imperfect εἶχον (σέσε-χον, ἔεχον) ·
ἕπομαι (σέπομαι), imperfect εἰπόμην (σεσεπόμην, ἐεεπόμην) ; εἴδον
(ἔϜιδον), second aorist of ὁράω (Ϝοράω) ; ἄγνμι (ράγῡνυμι, aorist ἔαξα
(ἔϜαξα).

837.	The augment, both syllabic and temporal, is often omitted.

838.	Compound Verbs. — Some prepositions (originally adverbs)
are prefixed to verbs, the whole forming a compound. If the
preposition ends with a vowel and the verb begins with one, the
vowel of the preposition is usually elided (575), as διίστημι
(διά-ἵστημι), ἀφαιρέω (ἀπό-αἱρέω (582)).

839.	The augment of compound verbs comes between the
preposition and the verb. If two vowels are thus brought
together, the first is usually elided, as ἀπολύω loose, free ; imperfect
ἀπέλυον (ἀπό-ἔλυον) ; aorist ἀπέλυσα (ἀπό-ἔλῡσα).

840.	Imperfect. — The imperfect (a secondary tense (816)) is
formed by adding the secondary endings (821) to the augmented
stem of the present, as λύω I loose, imperfect ἔλυον I was loosing;
τίθημι I place, imperfect ἐτίθην.

841.	First Aorist. — The first aorist of vowel and mute verbs
(849) (a secondary tense, 816) is regularly formed by adding
-σ(σ)α to the augmented verb stem, followed by the personal
endings of the secondary tenses. If the verb stem ends in a
long vowel or a consonant only one σ is ever added; if it ends
in a short vowel, either one or two sigmas may be used.

842.	“Mixed” Aorists. — A few aorists (sometimes called
“ mixed aorists ”) are formed by adding -σο/ε, followed by the personal
endings of the secondary tenses, to the augmented verb stem.

843.	ἵημι throw, send; δίδωι give, grant; and τίθημι put, place,
have -κα in the aorist instead of -σα.

844.	Future. — The future (a primary tense) of vowel and
mute verbs (849) is regularly formed by adding the tense suffix
-σ(σ)ε/ο to the verb stem, followed by the personal endings of
the primary tenses.

<pb n="274"/>

845.	If the verb stem ends in a long vowel, the stem is not
affected by the addition of -σο/ε and -σα in the formation of the
future and aorist.

846.	If the verb stem ends in a short vowel, all tenses except
the present and imperfect regularly lengthen this, α and ε becoming
η; ο becoming ω ; as ποιέω, ποιήσω, ἐποίησα; χολόω, χολώσω,
ἐχόλωσα.

847.	Some verbs do not lengthen the short vowel according to
the rule in 846.

848.	These, and a few others, usually have σ before the personal
ending of the perfect middle and the aorist passive.

849.	Classes of Verbs.—Verbs are called vowel verbs, liquid
verbs, nasal verbs, and mute verbs, according as their stem ends
in a vowel, a liquid, a nasal, or a mute.

850.	Mute Verbs. — If-the verb stem ends in a mute, the following
euphonic changes take place:

1)	a labial mute (π, β, φ) unites with the sigma following and
forms ψ, as πέμπω, πέμψω (πέμπσω), ἔπεμψα (ἔπεμπσα) send, escort:
ἀμείβω, ἀμείψω, ἤμειψα (ἀμείβσω, ἤμειβσα) (exchange ;

2)	a palatal mute (κ, γ, χ) unites with the sigma following and
forms ξ, as ἀρή-γω, ἀρήξω (ἀρήγσω), ἤρηξα (ἤρηγσα) help, assist;
τεύχω, τεύξω (τεύχσω), ἔτευξα (ἔτευχσα) make, fashion, cause.

3)	a lingual mute (τ, δ, Θ) before the σ is assimilated (610, 4),
as πείθω, πείσω, ἔπεισα persuade; κλέπτω, κλέψω, ἔκλεψα steal.

851.	Liquid and Nasal Verbs. —If a verb stem ends in a liquid
(λ, p) or a nasal (μ, v), the future is regularly formed by adding
-εσε/ο, with the loss of σ between vowels (603), to the verb stem,
to which are attached the primary personal endings, as βάλλω,
βαλέω (from βαλέσω) throw, shoot.

852.	In a few cases the first ε is omitted, and σ is retained in
verbs of this kind, as ὄρνῡμι, ὄρσω arouse, stir up.

853.	A few verbs in addition to those with liquid and nasal
stems have lost σ in the future, as καλέω, καλέω call, summon. In
general these verbs have a liquid or nasal before the final vowel

<pb n="275"/>

of the stem, and imitate the forms of the futures of liquid and
nasal verbs.

854.	Those formations in which σ is dropped after α or ε are
sometimes called “ Attic futures.”

855.	A few verbs have active forms in the present, but middle
forms in the future, as ἀκούω, ἀκούσομαι hear.

856.	Verbs with liquid and nasal stems regularly form their
aorists by dropping the σ and lengthening the stem vowel by
compensation (601), α becoming η, ε becoming ει, ι becoming ῑ,
and υ becoming ῡ, as φαίνω (φαν-), φανέω (φανέσω), ἔφηνα (ἔφανσα)
show; μένω, μενέω (μενέσω), ἔμεινα (ἔμενσα) remain, await.

857.	In some cases the σ is retained in formations of this kind,
as ὄρνϋμι, ὦρσα stir up, arouse; κέλλω, ἔκελσα land; κύρω, κύρσω
meet.

858.	The present of most liquid and nasal verbs regularly
lengthens the last syllable of the stem by compensation (601)
as the original form of the stem of these verbs ended in consonantal
ι (600).

859.	Presents in -λλω are from an earlier form in -λιω. Thus
ἀγγέλλω, βάλλω, στέλλω, τέλλω, etc., were Originally ἀγγελίω, βαλίω,
στελίω, τελίω, etc. In these cases the last syllable of the stem
is lengthened by doubling the final λ.

860.	Verbs with presents in -αινω, -αιρω, -εινω, -ειρω, -ῑνω, -ῑρω, -ῡνω,
-ῡρω originally had the endings -ανιω, -αριω, -ενιω, -εριω, -ινιω, -ιριω
-υνιω, -υριω (consonantal ι, 600) respectively.

861.	The quantity of the last vowel of the stem of many verbs
often varies, as λύω, λῡσω, ἔλῡσα, λέλνκα*, λέλυμαι, ἐλύθην.

862.	Ablaut (vowel gradation, 593-595) is seen in the various
tense systems of many verbs, particularly in what are known as
“second” (863) tenses. The second aorist and second passive
systems commonly have the weak (594-595) grades ι, υ, α. The
other systems usually have the corresponding strong grades ει
(οι), ευ (ου), η (ω); οι, ον, ω in the second perfect. When ε is preceded
or followed by a liquid or a nasal its weak grade is α.

<pb n="276"/>

863.	Second Tenses. — Many verbs have what are called second
tenses, as second aorists (active, middle, and passive), and second
perfects and pluperfects (active). These second tenses are irregular
in formation, and are thus named to distinguish them from
the more common, regularly formed tenses, which are called first
tenses.

864.	The meaning of these second tenses ordinarily corresponds
to that of the first tenses, except in the comparatively few cases
when a verb has both forms. Then the first and second tenses
may differ slightly in meaning, usually by the first being transitive
(sometimes causative), the second intransitive, Compare the
Americanism shine, shined, shined, used transitively, as in the
expression “ he shined my shoes,” with the more common forms
of the verb, shine, shone, shone, used intransitively, as “ the sun
shone.” “ Shined ” may be compared in form and meaning to a
first aorist, while “ shone ” would correspond in form and meaning
to a second aorist. Thus in Greek, ἔβην (2d aor.) signifies
I went, walked (intransitive), while ἔβησα (1st aor.) signifies I
caused to go, walked (transitive), as in English I walked my horse
(ἔβησα ἵππον) i.e. I caused my horse to walk.

865.	Second aorists are formed in various ways :

1)	A common method is for them to have the secondary (816)
endings, following the thematic vowel ε/ο, thus being conjugated
like the imperfect, as ἔχω, ἕξω, ἔσχον to have, where ἔσχον the
second aorist is conjugated like ἔλυον, the imperfect of λὐω to loose.

2)	Many have the secondary endings attached directly to the
tense stem, and thus are conjugated like the aorist passive, hut
without the Θ of the passive stem. Thus ἔβην (βαίνω), ἔδῡν (δύω),
ἔγνων (γιγνώσκω), etc. These are athematic (797) of course.

3)	Others end in -α and are conjugated with the same endings
as the first (regular) aorists, hut without the σ, as εἶπα, ἔκηα.

4)	Many are reduplicated (867), as ἤγαγον [ἄγω], κεχαρόμην

[χαίρω].

Note. — The stem of the second aorist usually diSers from the
present, regularly standing in ablaut (593-5) relation to it, as βαίνω,
ἔβην; λείπω, ἔλιπον.

<pb n="277"/>

866.	The stem of the singular of athematic (797, 865,2) second
aorists regularly stands in ablaut (593-5) relation to the stem
found in the dual and plural.

867.	Reduplication. — The perfect and pluperfect (with a few
presents, second aorists and futures) in all modes have reduplication
(doubling), which regularly denotes completed (sometimes
intensified) action, a state, or a condition.

868.	Verbs beginning with a single consonant, except ρ, prefix
this consonant, followed by the letter ε, as δέω, δέδῡκα go in.
Often the stem stands in ablaut (593-5) relation to the stem of the
present, as βαίνω (βαν-, βα-), βέβηκα come, go.

869.	Verbs beginning with a double consonant (518), with two
consonants (except a mute followed by a liquid or nasal (509, 516),
those beginning with ρ, and some beginning with μ, instead of
being reduplicated, simply add ε, the reduplication in these cases
having the same form as the syllabic augment (830-1).

870.	A rough mute when reduplicated is changed to its cognate
smooth (510-511), as φύω, πέφυκα ; θνήσκω, τέθνηκα. This is deaspiration
(dissimilation) (619).

■ 871. In verbs beginning with a vowel or diphthong the reduplication
has the form of the temporal (831) augment, as οίχομαι, ὤχωκα.

872.	Verbs beginning with a vowel which was formerly preceded
by a lost consonant may take the reduplication in the form
of the syllabic augment (830-1).

873.	Some verbs beginning with α, ε, or ο, followed by a consonant,
reduplicate by repeating this vowel and the consonant and
by lengthening the vowel, a and ε becoming η, and o becoming ω,
as ἔδω, ἐδήδώς ; ἀραρίσκω, ἄρηρα; ὄλλῡμι, ὄλωλα. This is sometimes
called “ Attic reduplication.”

874.	A few verbs reduplicate the present by prefixing the first
consonant of the stem followed by i, as ΐστημι βηστημι 603-4),
τίθημι, δίδωμι, ἵημι (σίσημι 603—4), πίμπλημι, γίγνομαι, γιγνωσκω,
μιμνήσκω.

<pb n="278"/>

875.	When the reduplicated perfect begins with a consonant,
the pluperfect prefixes the syllabic augment (e) to the reduplication,
as βέβηκα (perfect), ἐβεβήκεα. (pluperfect).

876.	In other cases the pluperfect usually retains the temporal
(831) apgment of the perfect unchanged.

877.	Perfect. — The first (regular) perfect adds -m, the pluperfect
-*e, to the reduplicated theme to form the singular. The dual
and plural regularly have the endings of the second perfect, except
at times in the third plural, which often has the endings of the
first perfect.

878.	The stem is not affected by the addition of -κα, -κε, except
that a final short vowel is usually lengthened (846).

879. This form of the perfect (first or regular perfect) is found
only in verbs with vowel stems and in only about twenty verbs in
the whole of the Homeric poems.

880.	Second Perfect. — The stem of the second (irregular) perfect
is formed by adding -α to the reduplicated theme, and the
pluperfect by adding -ε.

881.	The second perfects are the earlier and are much more
common in the Homeric poems than are the first or κ-perfects.
They are found regularly in verbs with consonantal and sometimes
in those with vowel stems.

882.	The singular of the first and second perfect and pluperfect
active regularly stands in ablaut (593-5) relation to the dual and
plural, the dual and plural having the weak (disappearing) grade
(594-5), while the singular has the strong grade.

883.	Both perfect and pluperfect are rare in Homer, the latter
occurring in only about twenty verbs.

884.	The reduplication is occasionally omitted.

885.	Verbs compounded with a preposition (838) regularly
have the augment and the reduplication between the preposition
and the verb, as ἀμφιβέβηκa, προβέβουλα (ἀμφιβαίνω, προβούλομαι).

886.	When futures and second aorists are reduplicated it is
usually after the manner of the reduplication of perfects ; presents
are reduplicated in various ways, but chiefly with ι (874).

<pb n="279"/>887-898]

HOMERIC GREEK

887.	Middle Voice. — The endings of the middle are different
from those of the active.

888.	Passive. — The aorist passive has active endings; the
other forms of the passive have middle endings.

889.	Since only the aorist<note>But see 817, note, for two exceptions.</note> of the passive differs in form from
the middle, all the other tenses having the same forms in both
voices, the context must determine in these other tenses which
voice is intended.

890.	The aorist middle, especially the athematic (797) aorist,
is often used instead of the aorist passive. On the other hand
the aorist passive is often used with a middle meaning.

891.	The perfect and pluperfect, middle and passive are athematic
(797), i.e. the personal endings are attached directly to the
reduplicated verb stem.

892.	The future perfect passive stem is formed by adding -σε/ο
to the perfect middle (passive) stem. A vowel which precedes
this -σε/ο is lengthened, even though it be short in the perfect
middle.

893:. The first aorist passive stem is formed by adding θε/η to
the verb stem.

894.	Sometimes a sigma also is added to the verb stem before
the θε/η·

895.	Before the theta of the passive stem, π and β become φ ;
κ and γ become χ; τ, δ, and Θ regularly become σ (610, 1, 2).

896.	Many verbs have a second aorist passive, which does not
have the Θ, but otherwise has the same endings as the first aorist
passive.

897.	Deponent Verbs. — There are many verbs which have no
active forms, but the middle, or the middle and passive are used
with an active meaning. These are called deponent verbs.

898.	Defective Verbs. — Many verbs do not have all the principal
parts, that is, they are defective. When any parts are omitted



<pb n="280"/>

from the vocabularies of this book, it indicates that these forms
do not occur either in Homer or in later classical Greek.

899.	Periphrastic Forms. — There are some forms of the verb in
Greek which are expressed at times by a compound of the verb
to be (εἰμί) with a participle of the verb. These are called periphrastic
forms. The most important are:

1)	The perfect and pluperfect, represented at times by the perfect
participle with the present and imperfect respectively of εἰμί.

2)	The future perfect, both active and passive, represented by
the future of εἰμί with the perfect active and middle (passive)
participle.

900.	Iterative Forms. — Many verbs have what are called iterative
forms in the imperfect and aorist, active and middle. These
have no augment and add σκ followed by the personal endings
to the verb stem. Some have a connecting vowel (usually ε,
sometimes α), others do not.., Thus from ποθέω comes ποθέεσκον,
from φθινύθω comes φθινύθεσκον, etc.

901.	A few verbs have special forms in the present and second
aorist made by adding Θ to the tense stem, as ἔσχεθον from ἔχω
(2d aor. ἔσχον), φθινύθω from φθίνω.

Accent of Verbs

902.	Verbs, both simple and compound (838), usually have the
recessive accent (548), except in the following cases:

1)	A few second aorists imperative, 2d singular, have the acute
on the ultima, as εἰπἐ, ἐλθέ, εὑρέ, λαβέ. When compounded these
verbs have the recessive accent.

2)	The following forms accent the penult: the first aorist active
infinitive, the second aorist active infinitive (usually contracted
with the ultima), the second aorist middle infinitive (except πρἰασθαι,
ὄνασθαι), the perfect middle (passive) infinitives and participles,
and all infinitives in -ναι or -μεν, except those in -μεναι.

3)	The following participles have the acute on the ultima for
the masculine and neuter, and the circumflex on the penult of the
feminine: the second aorist active, all those of the third declension
(except the first aorist active) ending in -? in the nominative

<pb n="281"/>903-904]

HOMERIC GREEK

singular masculine, and the present particijfles of εἰμί, εἶμι and

κίω (ἐών, ἰών, κιών).

4)	For the variations in the enclitic forms of εἰμί, φημί, see the
paradigms 964, 967, and 554-556.

5)	The accent of athematic optatives never goes further to the
left than the diphthong containing the ι of the mode sign.

6)	In unaugmented compound verbs the accent cannot go further
to the left than the last syllable of the preposition with
which the verb is compounded.

7)	Unaugmented monosyllabic second aorists have the circumflex
when containing a long vowel, as βῆ (= ἔβη).

8)	In augmented and reduplicated compound forms the accent
cannot go further back than the augment or reduplication.

9)	Middle imperatives in -εο have the acute on the penult when
compounded with monosyllabic prepositions.

10)	The exceptions are only apparent in the accent of contracted
forms 936-944, including the aorist passive subjunctive, λυθέω —
λυθῶ, and optative, λυθέ-ῑ-μεν = λυθῶμιν, the future of liquid and
nasal verbs, and the present and second aorist active and middle
subjunctive of most -μι verbs. See 951-952.

903.	Final -αι and -οι of the optative, and the final -οι of the
locative οἴκοι at home, are always considered long when determining
the accent; otherwise final -αι, -οι are considered short for
purposes of accent.

904.	Conjugation of λύω<note>Observe that the υ of λύω is long only when followed by σ; otherwise it is short.</note>	<gloss>I loose</gloss>

944.	These verbs may be contracted as indicated above, and
are regularly so contracted in later classical Greek.

945.	The manuscripts of the Homeric poems often show a
series of forms for verbs ending in -αω (as τϊμάω) and in -οω (as
χολόω), which are known as “assimilated” (sometimes called
“ distracted ”) forms. - In these cases ae, α«, ay, ay give a double
a sound, by the a assimilating the e sound; but αο, αω, αοι, aov
give a double o sound, by the o assimilating the a sound. Usually
one of the vowels is lengthened, sometimes both.

at = 1) αα	αω = 1) οω	οο = 1) οω
2) αα	2) ωω	2) ωο
α€ΐ = 1) αα	αοι = 1) οω	οοι = οα»
2) αα	2) ωοι	οου = οω
arj = 1) αα	αου = 1) οω	
2) αα	2) ωω	
αο — 1) οω		
2) ωο		
946. These forms are used also in futures in		-αω from -ασω (603).
947. They are found o.nly when the second syllable in the original form is long by nature or by position (522).		
948. The following forms of όράω (popa-) examples of assimilation of an -αω verb :		see, may serve as

951.	Tlie second aorist subjunctive of -μι verbs (949 ff.) seems
to have bad a double form of inflection:

1)	With a short thematic (T96) vowel, as θήω, θψκ, θψι, θψτον,
θηίτην, θηομεν, θηετε, θηουσι (τίθημι put, place).

2)	With a long thematic (796) vowel, as θήω, θήτμ;, θή$, θήητον,
θηητον, θήωμεν, θήητε, θήωσι.

The vowel of the stem is then shortened (572), producing^—

3)	θίω, Oerjs, θίτ), θέητον, θίητον, θίωμεν, θεητε, θίωσι.

This form then undergoes contraction (584-585), giving —

4)	θω, Ofis, 6rj, θητον, θητον, θωμεν, θήτε, θωσι.

952.	The subjunctives of athematic (797 ; 865,2) second aorists
and the subjunctives passive of both first and second aorists are
similarly formed. Thus, λνθω, λνθήί, λνθή, etc., contracted from
\νθεω, λυθε-ης, λυθέτ], etc.; τραφώ, τραφής, τραφ-rj, etc., contracted
from τραφεω, τραφεης, τραφεη, etc.

<pb n="312"/>in. SYNTAX

GENERAL

970.	The subject of a finite verb is in the nominative case, as
δλίκοντο 8k λάοὶ and the people kept perishing, Ιδεισεν 8' ὁ γέρων and
that old man feared.

971.	The subject of an infinitive is regularly in the accusative,
ἀμμε δίω αφ απονοστησειν I think we shall return home, βονλομ εγω
λάδν σόον ίμμΐναι I wish my people to be safe. The subject of the
infinitive is usually omitted when it is the same as the subject or
object, either direct or indirect, of the main verb.

972.	When the infinitive is used to express a command (1107,

11), its subject, when expressed, is in the nominative when of the
second person, and in the accusative when of the third person, as
σν τόν y έπέεσσι καθάπτεσθαι μαλακοΐσιν but do you attack him with
soft words.

973.	A finite verb regularly agrees with its subject nominative
in person and number, except:

1)	A neuter plural subject may take its verb in the singular, as
ωχετο κηλa θεοίo the shafts of the god sped, τὰ 8έ8ασται these have
been distributed.

2)	With two or more subjects connected by and, the verb
may agree with one of the subjects and be understood with the
rest, as μη vv tol ον χραίσμη σκηπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοίο lest the Sceptre
and the fillet of the god avail thee naught, el 8η δμον πόλεμός re 8αμά
καὶ λοιμός ἀχαιονς if war and pestilence at the same time crush the
Achaeans.

3)	When referring to two, the plural and dual are often interchanged
or united, as δανώ 8έ οὶ ἀσσε φάανθεν and her eyes appeared
terrible, τώ ol ίσον κηρϋκε καὶ δτρηρω θεράποντε who were his two
heralds and ready attendants, τώ 8 αΰτώ μάρτνροι Ιστῶν and let these
two be witnesses.

974.	A noun or an adjective in the predicate after verbs
meaning be, appear, become, be thought, made, named, chosen,
regarded, and the like, agrees with the subject in case, as δμηγερέες

<pb n="313"/>975-979]

HOMERIC GREEK

re yivovTO and they became assembled; os apioros Ἀχαιῶν ΐΰχεταὶ eivai
who boasts that he is far the mightiest of the Achaeans, to Se roi
κηρ aSerai ctvai but that seems (to be) even as death to you, SeiXos re
καὶ οΰπδαι/os καλΐοίμψ I should be called both coward and worthless.

975.	Apposition. — A noun used in connection with another
noun to describe it, and denoting the same person or thing, agrees
with it in ease, and is said to be in apposition with it, as ἀτρνίδης
αναζ ἀνδρώv the SOn of Atreus, Icing Of men, Χρύσην ητίμασεν αρητηρα
he slighted Chryses, the priest.

976.	The verb ἀμὶ (especially the forms of the third person
singular and plural ίστί, dai) is often omitted, when it can easily
be supplied from the context.

977.	Other words are at times omitted, as να! μα τόSc σκηπτρνν =
ναι μα τόδΐ σκηπτρον δμννμὶ yea, by this sceptre (I swear).

HOURS
Nominative Case

978.	A noun is in the nominative:

1)	When it is the subject of a finite verb (970).

2)	When it is in the predicate after certain verbs (974).

3)	Sometimes for the vocative, as δημοβόρος /WiXevs king, ivho
devour (the goods of) the people!

Genitive Case

The Greek genitive represents two earlier cases (657):
1) the genitive proper, denoting the class to which a person or
thing belongs. 2) the ablatival genitive (formerly the ablative),
usually expressing separation, source, cause.

979.	Some of the most common uses of the genitive are:

1)	Possession, as ψϋχας ηρώων souls of warriors, Aios βουλή the
will of Zeus, ini vijas Ἀχαιῶν to the ships of the Achaeans: the
possessive genitive.

2)	The subject of an action or feeling, as μηνώ ἀχιληος the wrath
of Achilles (i.e. felt by Achilles) : the subjective genitive.

3)	The object of an action or feeling, as ἀχιλλ^ο? ποθή a yearning
of (i.e. for) Achilles, πόσως καὶ εδητάος Ipov the desire of (i.e. for)
food and drink: the objective genitive.

<pb n="314"/>SYNTAX, NOMINATIVE AND GENITIVE [980-984

4)	Material or contents, as πνραϊ νεκύων funeral pyres of corpses,
εκατόμβάς ταύρων rfi αιγῶν hecatombs of bulls and of goats: genitive
of material.

5)	Measure of time, space, or value (price), as κούρης Χρνσηιδος
ἀποινα δίξασθαι. to accept the ransoms for the maiden Chryseis:
genitive of price.

6)	Cause or origin, as ἐνχωλης ίπιμεμφεται he finds fault on
account of a vow (unperformed), χωόμενον γυναικός vexed for the sake
of a woman: the genitive of cause.

7)	The whole after words denoting the part, as τις θεών; which
(one) of the gods ? τό πλεΐον πολεμοιο the greater part of the war: the
partitive genitive.

980.	The partitive genitive may follow all adjectives, adverbs,
nouns, and participles, which denote a part, as οίωνοπόλων οχ
ἀριστος far the best of augurs, οΐος ἀργείων alone of the Argives, των
S' ἀλλων ον τις δρατο but riot any one of the others saw her.

981.	A genitive in the predicate after verbs meaning to be, etc.,
and other copulative verbs, may express any of the relations of
the attributive genitive (979, 1-7).

982.	Any . verb whose action affects the object in part only, or
which means to share, or to enjoy, may take the genitive, as ἀρνων

HOMERIC GREEK

having reminded him of this, ®ins ον Χήθετ εφετμεων Thetis did not
forget the behests.

985.	The genitive follows verbs signifying to rule, lead, direct,
as os Τενεόοω ἀνασσας (thou) who dost rule Tenedos, os πάντων
Ἀρχείων κρατεει who rules all the Argives.

986.	Verbs signifying fulness and want take the genitive of
material (979,4). Those meaning to fill take the accusative of the
thing filled, and the genitive of material, as μενεος φρένεs tημπΧαντο
his diaphragm was filled with rage, κονροι κρητηραs επεστέψαντο ποτοΐο
the young men filled the mixing bowls to the brim with drink.

987.	The genitive may denote that from which anything is
separated or distinguished (genitive of separation); hence it is used,
after verbs meaning remove, restrain, release, cease, fail, differ, give
up, etc., as Xyy εριόος cease from strife, ποΧεμον S ἀποπαvto but
refrain from war. It is used also to denote source, as Sivy κΧαχγη

by the genitive, as τὰ ποΧίων έξεπράθομεν whatsoever) we took as
spoil from the cities, περίσχεο παώός protect your son.

990.	The genitive may denote time within which anything
takes place.

991.	Many adjectives kindred in meaning or derivation to
verbs which take the genitive are followed by the genitive
(objective).

992.	Many adverbs, chiefly those of place, and those derived
from adjectives which take the genitive, are construed with the
genitive, as τηΧόθι πάτρης far from her native land, πάροιθ' avroio in
front of him, Χιμενος ἐντός within the harbor.

993.	Adjectives and adverbs of the comparative degree take the
genitive (988), unless followed by ἡ (ήε) than, as ον εθίν εστι χερείων

<pb n="316"/>GENITIVE AND DATIVE CASES

[994-997

she is not inferior to her (literally not worse than), φίρτερός είμι
σέθεν I am mightier than you, γλυκέων μέλιτος sweeter than honey.

994.	A noun and a participle not closely connected grammatically
with the rest of the sentence may stand by themselves
in the genitive. This construction is called the genitive absolute.
Examples : αντον κϊνηθέντος as the god moved, εμεΐι ζωντος καὶ επι
χθονϊ διρκομενοιο while 1 live and look out upon the earth. See 1111.

Dative Case

The Greek dative represents three earlier cases (657):
1) the dative proper, denoting to or for which something is or is
done. 2) the instrumental (dative), denoting instrument, means,
manner, cause, accompaniment. 3) the locative (dativi), denoting
place where and time when.

995.	The indirect object of a transitive verb is in the dative, as
την οὶ Ή-ope Φοίβος Ἀπόλλων which Phoebus Apollo granted to him,
πως τοι δώσουσι γέρας how shall they give you a prize of honor ?

996.	Many verbs which in English are transitive are intransitive
in Greek and take the dative. The verbs of this class are mainly
those meaning serve, benefit, defend, assist, please, obey, trust,
satisfy, advise, exhort, and their opposites; also those signifying
abuse, anger, blame, envy, friendliness, hostility, reproach, threats,
etc., as βασιληι χολωβεις incensed at the king, ονκ ἀτρειδ-η -ηνδανε θομω
it was not pleasing to the son of Atreus in his soul, μη vv τοι ον
χραίσμη σκηπτρον καὶ στέμμα θιοιο lest the sceptre and the fillet of the
god avail thee not, επείθετο μνθω he obeyed the command, μοι ἀρηζειν
to defend me, ore χάσεται avSpl χέρψ when he becomes enraged at an
inferior, ἀπειλ-ήσω 8έ τοι ώδε and I shall threaten you as follows, μηνί
Ἀχαιοΐσιν continue to rage against the Achaeans.

997.	A person or thing for whose advantage or disadvantage a
thing exists or is done is put in the dative, as αΰτονς 8έ ίλώρια τεΰχε
κννεσσιν οιωνοϊσὶ τε δαΐτα and it made themselves a booty for the dogs
and a banquet for the birds, παΐ8α 8’ έμοὶ λνσαι but free for me my
child, τάδε μοι κρηηνον έέλδωρ accomplish for me this desire, ημΐν από
λοιγόν ἀμνναι to ward Off destruction for (from) US, καὶ 8η μοι γέρας

for Achilles, συν 8' ήμίν 8αΐτα ταράξη and lie should throw the banquet
into confusion for us.

998.	The dative of interest or reference denotes the person to
whose case a statement is limited.

999.	The dative with είμί, γίγνομαι, and verbs of similar meaning,
may denote the possessor, as των 8' ἀλλων ὰ μοι Ιστι παρά. νηὶ but of
all else which are mine beside my ship, τώ ol εσαν κήρϋκε who were
his two heralds.

1000.	The dative of the personal pronouns often denotes the
possessor, without such verbs as είμί, γίγνομαι, etc., as ἀσσε δ« ol
7τυρὶ είκτην and his two eyes were like fire, δ μοι γέρας ερχεται ἀλλη my
prize of honor is going elsewhere, 8εινω δε oi ἀσσε φάανθεν and her
eyes gleamed terribly.

1001.	The dative is used after verbs meaning to give commands,
and to lead the way for, as νηεσσ ηγήσατ 'Ἀχαιῶν “Ιλιον εϊσω and he
led the way for the ships of the Achaeans into Troy, Μνρμιδόνεσσι
ανασσε rule the Myrmidons.

1002.	The dative follows some verbal nouns and many adjec-
. fives and adverbs of kindred meaning with verbs which take the

dative, as τα κάκ εστὶ φίλα φρεσὶ evil is dear to your heart, ον τὶ μοι
αίτιοὶ ε’ισιν they are in no wise blamable toward me, εχθιστός μοὶ εσσι
you are most hateful to me, έπεϊ μάλα oi φίλος ηεν since he was exceeding
dear to him, χαλεποὶ τοι εσονται they will be (too) hard for you,
ϊλαος εσσεται ημΐν he will be propitious toward us.

1003.	The dative is used after all words signifying likeness, or
unlikeness, agreement, disagreement, union, or approach, as νυκτι
εοικώς like unto night, ἀσσε δε ol πνρ'ι είκτην and his eyes were like
unto fire, oh σοὶ ποτέ ίσον εχω γέρας never have I a prize of honor equal
to you(rs), επιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν like unto the immortals.

1004.	The dative follows many verbs compounded with iv, ro,
and επί, and some compounded with πρός, παρά, περί, and υπό, as
αυτοίσι βέλος εφϊείς hurling a dart upon them, os 'Aργείοισι κήδε’ ίφη-
κεν who brought sorrows upon the Argives, νηυσι παρημένος sitting
beside the ships, σοὶ γε παρεζετο she sat down beside you, οὶ συμφράσ

φημι but I advise my mother, Ινωρτο γελο; θεοΐσίν laughter arose
among the gods.

1005.	The dative is used to denote cause, manner, means, instrument,
and agency, as τίσειαν Δαι/αοι εμὰ δάκρυα σοΐσι βέλεσσιν may the
Danaans atone for my tears with thy darts, επεσιν καὶ χερσιν ἀρήζειν
to assist with words and hands, νπερπολίησι τάχ ἀν iron θυμόν ολέσση

seized his knees with her iefi (hand), rol κεφαλή κατανεύσομαι I shall
nod assent to you with my head.

1006.	The dative is used to denote the circumstance, or that
by which a thing or person is accompanied. The dative of circumstance
is most common with abstract or semi-abstract words,
and is often used to express the reason or occasion, σο! 3.μ ίσπό-
μεθα we accompany you, ol oi ἀμα τράφεν ηδέ -γένοντο who were bred

Hephaestus made a home for each with cunning mind, ns σφωε εριδι
ξννέηκε; who brought these two together in strife i

1007.	The dative is used with verbs signifying to be with, follow,
join, agree, be like, fight, strive, trust, be pleased, and occasionally
with those meaning to buy and to a,bound, as οίκ ἀτρείδη ήνδανε
it ivas not pleasing to the son of Atreus, καὶ oi πείθονται 'Ἀχαιοὶ and
the Achaeans trust in him, ἀνδράσιν μάχεσθαι to fight with men, καρ-
τιστοι; εμάχοντο they fought with the mightiest, εριζέμεναι βασιληι to
strive with the king, οϋ τοι μαχήσομαι I icill not fight with you.

1008.	The dative is used to denote the agent, after the past
tenses, particularly the perfect and pluperfect of the passive.

1009.	The dative with or without a preposition is used to denote
the place where an action takes place. It is used of towns and
countries, the great divisions of the world, the chief spheres of

<pb n="319"/>1010-1014]

HOMERIC GREEK

action, of the parts of a thing, or of the human body, after some
verbs that imply locality or time, and after some verbs of motion
where we should expect the accusative with a preposition, as ονχ
ήνδανε ϋμω it was not pleasing in his soul, τόζ ωμοισιν εχων having
his bow on his shoulders, τοΐσι S’ ανεστη Κάλχας and Calchas arose
among them, μη κλεπτε νόω do not play the thief in your heart, ἀμφω
θϋμΰ φιλεονσα loving both (of them) in her heart, φρεσΐ θύει he rages'
m his mind, ημενον κορνφβ seated upon the summit, μάχη Tρωεσσιν
ἀρηγειν to assist the Trojans in battle, Οεκ ἀτη S' ἀγορήνε καλεσσατο
λάον ἀχιλλενς but on the tenth (day) Achilles summoned the people
to an assembly, δωδέκατη S’ έλενσεται Ονλνμπόνε but on the twelfth
(day) he will come to Olympus, πολλά? Si ψΰχας *Ἀιδι προιαψεν and
sent many souls to Hades, συ S' ivl φρεσΐ βάλλεο σησιν and do you
place it in your heart, (Lyova δέ δώρα ἀνακτι and they are taking presents
to the lord, κάππεσ ον ἐν Λ,ήμνω I fell into Lemnos.

1010.	The dative is used to denote in what particular point or
respect something is true, as δ γὰρ βίη οὐ πατρδς ἀμείνων for he is
better in strength than his own father. Cf.· 1014.

Accusative Case

1011.	The direct object of a transitive verb is in the accusative
case, as νοΰσον ωρσε he roused a plague, Χρύσην ητιμασεν he dishonored
Chryses, λνσόμενος θνγατρα to ransom his own daughter, φερων
ἀποινα bearing ransoms, στεμματ εχων having fillets, ελίσσετο Ἀχαιούς
he kept entreating the Achaeans.

1012.	Any verb whose meaning permits may take an accusative
of cognate form, or equivalent meaning. This is called the cognate
accusative, and may follow intransitive as well as transitive
verbs, as εΐπας επος you have spoken a word, όδδν έλθεμεναι to go (on)
a journey, επος τ' εφατο and she spoke a word.

1013.	The words επος, μύθος, and εργον with pronouns or adjectives
are at times practically equivalent to the neuter of the pronoun
or adjective without these words, as ε’ὶ σοι πάν εργον νπείξομαι
if I shall yield to you in every matter.

1014.	An accusative restricting the force of the verb to a part,
character, quality, or attribute of the subject may follow many

<pb n="320"/>DATIVE AND ACCUSATIVE CASES [10X5-1020

Teibs that are intransitive or. reflexive in meaning. This is the
accusative of the part affected, or accusative of specification, and may
also accompany a noun, an adjective, or even a whole sentence, as
7τόδας ώκνς ἀχιλλευς swifl-footed Achilles (literally Achilles swift ivith
respect to his feet), χωόμ(νος κηρ enraged in heart, οὐ ίθίν ϊστι yepetW,
ον Βίμας obBe φυήν οϋτ ἀρ φρίνας οΰδὶ τι Ιργα she is not inferior to her,
neither in build nor beauty nor disposition, nor yet in accomplishments.

1015.	The accusative is used to denote extent of time or space,
as 7πχν δ’ τ)μαρ φ(ρόμην and all day long I fell, πρόπαν !}μυρ Βαίνυντο
the whole day through they feasted, ἀκίων δ)ν ηστο he sat silent a long
time.

1016.	The accusative dependent upon an omitted verb follows
the adverbs of swearing νή, and μά, as μα Ἀπόλλωνα by Apollo!
val μα τόοι σκηπτρον yea, by this sceptre! (977)

1017.	The verbs Λπον and αύδάω, and more often their compounds,
may take an accusative of the person addressed, as Κάλ-
χαντα προσίαπίν he addressed Calchas, οὐδέ τὶ μχν 7τροσΐφωνεον nor did
they say anything to him.

1018.	The accusative may be used of the person about whom a
thing is told, hnown, thought, or provided:

1)	The person or thing is treated as the thing said or known,
and not merely as spoken or known about, as ovS’ ἡ ν' Ἀ-γαμίμνονα
ΐΐ-πτρ not even if you should say Agamemnon.

2)	The real object of the verb is a fact expressed by a limiting
clause or word.

1019.	Words denoting the goal are in the accusative after verbs
of motion, as ov κεν ΐκωμαι upon whomsoever) I may come, κνιση S’
ουρανόν Ικεν and the savor went to heaven, ΐρχεσθον κλισιην ἀχιληος
go to the barrack(s) of Achilles.

1020.	The following classes of verbs may be construed with
two accusatives:

1) Verbs of asking, teaching, reminding, demanding, clothing, unclothing,
depriving, and taking away, as ϊμ’ ἀφαιρἈται Χρϋσηίδα Φοί-
βος Ἀπόλλων Phoebus Apollo is depriving me of Chryseis, μψ* σν
rovS’ airoaipeo κονρην nor do you- deprive him of the maiden.

<pb n="321"/>1021-1025]

HOMERIC GREEK

2)	Verbs of naming, choosing, appointing, making, thinking,
regarding, and the like, as αϊτού; δε έλώρια τεΰχε Κ·υνεσσιν ο'ιωνόΐσὶ τ:
8αΐτα and made themselves a booty for the dogs and a banquet for
the birds, Sv Βριάρεων καλε'ονσι θεοί, ἀνδpcs 8e re νάντε; Ἀίγαιωνα whom
the gods call Briareiis, but all men (caff) Aegaeon.

3)	Verbs meaning to do anything to or say anything of a person.

1021.	The accusative may denote an object which -is affected by
an action, and a second accusative of the particular part affected
may be added (accusative of the whole and, part), as τι Se σε φρένas
ΐκίτο πένθος; but what grief has come upon you in your heart? περί
yap ρὰ e χαλκός ελεψεν φύλλα τε καὶ φλοιόν the bronze, has stripped it
of leaves and bark round about. Note. — Some would classify the
accusative of this last sentence under 1020 above.

Vocative Case

1022.	The vocative, with or without 3, is used in addressing a
person or thing, as θεὰ goddess! ω ἀχιλεὶ O Achilles! ἀτρείδαιsons
of Atreus! Note. — The nominative is often used for the vocative,
978, 3.

ADJECTIVES

1023.	The positive of an adjective may imply that the quality
indicated is not in the proper proportion for the purpose under
Consideration, as μη 8η πάντας εμους επιέλπεο μύθους ειόησειν ' χαλεποί
τοι ίσονται do not hope to know all my plans; they will be too hard
for you (to understand).

1024.	The comparative and superlative endings of adjectives
are often employed merely to denote an unusually high degree of
the quality signified, without any idea of comparison being involved.

1025.	An adjective agrees with its noun in gender, number, and
case, but not always in form, since they may belong to different
declensions, as νοῦσος κακή an evil plague, where νοῦσος, although
feminine, is of the second declension and ends in -ος. This rule
applies also to adjective pronouns and participles, as 
μυρι' ἄλγεα countless woes, 
πολλὰς δ’ Ἰφθίμουs ψυχάς Ἀΐδι προΐαψεν and sent many valiant souls to Hades, 
διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε these two separated after they had quarreled, 

<pb n="322"/>


δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς godlike Achilles, 
ἦλθε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας he came to the swift ships, 
θεοὶ Ὀλύμπια δώματ' ἔχοντες the gods who have Olympian homes.

1026.	When referring to two, the plural and the dual are freely
interchanged (973, 3), as δύο yeveai two generations, τώ δ’ αντώ
μάρτνροὶ ϊστων and these two themselves he witnesses.

1027.	An adjective or a participle, usually with the pronoun
ο, ἡ, τό, may be used substantively as a noun, as τὰ f «Ιόντα τὰ f
ίσσόμενα τ-ρό τ Ιόντα both what is, what will be, and what has been
before, τα κακὰ these calamities, such calamities (1034).

PRONOUNS

1028.	The Pronoun ό, ή, τό. — There are three chief uses of the
pronoun, δ, ἡ, τό:

1)	As an independent demonstrative (and third personal) pronoun,
meaning this, that, he, she, it. This is its original use, and
the one most commonly met with in Homer, as ὁ νονσον ώρσ: he
roused a plague, τον Χρύσην ητίμασιν ἀρητηρα ἀτρείδr/s the SOU of
Atreus dishonored that (■well-known) Chryses, the priest, την δ’ iγω
ον λνσω but I will not free her, ϋδασεν δ’ b γύρων and that old man
feared.

2)	As an article properly speaking (“the”), that is, modifying
and making definite a noun, but not having any particular demonstrative
force. This is its ordinary use in Greek after Homer.

3)	As a relative pronoun, as τον τόκε Ἀητω whom Leto bore, τω
ol ΐσαν κύ/pVKC who were his two heralds, την μοι δόσαν viis Ἀχαιών
whom the sons of the Achaeans gave unto me.

ΝρτΕ. — Many expressions in Homer which are translated into English
by the relative pronoun in a subordinate clause seem to have been
coordinate originally. Thus the pronoun (ό, ἡ, τό) in these last three
sentences may well have been thought of as demonstrative with asyndeton
rather than as relative, 1113-1114.

1029.	As air independent pronoun it has two main uses:

1) It is “resumptive,” that is, it refers to something already
mentioned, Χρύσην ητίμασ(.ν, ο γάρ η\θὶ θοας ivi νηας he dishonored
Chryses, for he came to the swift ships.

<pb n="323"/>1030-1040]

HOMERIC GREEK

2) It makes a contrast, usually in combinations, such as 6 pkv
... 6 δε', and other words which help to give this effect.

1030.	ό μϊν ... δ St and ol μϊν ... 61 8« are frequently used
to contrast both definite and indefinite persons and things.

1031.	Its use with an adversative particle generally, but not
always, marks a change of subject, as ὁ δε but the other.

1032.	The use of ό, ή, τό as an article has evidently arisen from
its employment as an independent pronoun, followed by a noun
in apposition, as ἡ δ’ ἀεκαυσα ἀμα τοισι γυνή Kiev but she went with
them against her will, i.e. the woman, where ywi; is added as an
afterthought for the sake of greater definiteness.

1033.	So also it may serve to introduce a new person, in this
case anticipating the noun, as αντάρ δ μήνα ν-ηνσι παρήμΐνος Sloyevrjs
Πτ^λτ^ος υΙός 7τόδας ώκνζ ἀχιλλενζ but he Icept raging as he sat beside
the ships, did the Zeus-born son of Peleus, the swift-footed Achilles.

1034.	With the adjective or participle it is often used as a
substantive, as το πλΰον the greater part, τα κακὰ these calamities,
such calamities (1027).

1035.	It is also used with the neuter accusative, singular or
plural, of the adjective as an adverb, as τα πρώτα at first (780-781).

1036.	On the other hand, the masculine or feminine with an
adverb may be used substantively.

1037.	Nouns with a possessive pronoun take the article only
when they refer to a definite individual, as το σόν μό/os this anger
of yours.

1038.	It usually has a demonstrative force, and its absence
does not mark a noun as indefinite, as μηνιν ἀαδε, ΘἈ, Πηληιάδεω
Ἀχιληος sing, goddess, the wrath of the son of Peleus, Achilles.

1039.	The Personal Pronouns. — The nominative of the personal
pronouns is used mainly for emphasis and contrast, as συ δε σννθίο
but do you consider. If the subject is unemphatic, the pronoun
is usually omitted, as Ss ΐφατο thus he spoke.

1040.	The oblique cases of the third personal pronoun are
anaphoric, that is, they have an antecedent previously expressed

<pb n="324"/>PRONOUNS

[1041-1045

to which they refer, when unaccented; but when they are accented
they have their original reflexive use, as από ω κάββαλεν νίόν she
hurled her son from her, καὶ οὶ πείθονται Ἀχαιοὶ and the Achaeans
trust in him.

1041.	Demonstrative Pronouns. — The demonstrative pronouns
are thus distinguished:

1)	(ε) κείνος, ἡ, o is used of .something remote from the speaker.

2)	ο, rj, τό differs from οὐτος, (έ)κεΐνος, όδε, etc., in that it usually
marks a contrast in objects, but does not distinguish them as
near and far, present and absent, etc.

3)	The compounds of ό, ή, τό are used of something near the
speaker, or of something associated with him.

4)	σίτο; is used of something which has been mentioned ah
ready, or else of something of particular interest or concern to
the second person.

5)	6, ή, τό in addition to being employed as a relative and as a
personal pronoun is used to mark a contrast.

6)	αντός in all its cases regularly means self, but at times may
mean same; it is regularly intensive and is used especially to contrast
a man or an object with other less important details, as
clothing, weapons, and appurtenances of various kinds.

1042.	Possessive Pronouns. — The possessive pronouns are as a

rule*equivalent to the possessive genitive of the personal pronoun,
as 7reus	—	7rats e/xoi).

1043.	The Interrogative Pronouns. — The interrogative rk, τί
who ? which? what ? may be either substantive or adjective, and
may,be used in either direct or indirect questions.

1044.	The Indefinite Pronoun. — The indefinite τίs, τὶ some (one),
something, any (one), anything may be either substantive or adjective,
but is sometimes almost the equivalent of the English
indefinite article, a(n), as τινα μάντιν ερείομεν let us ask a seer.

1045.	Relative Pronouns. — A relative agrees with its antecedent
in gender and number, but its case depends upon the construction
of the clause in which it stands, as μηνιν ἀειδε, ἡ 3λγε’
εθηκεν sing the wrath which caused Woes.

<pb n="325"/>1046-1053]

HOMERIC GREEK

1046.	The antecedent of the relative may be omitted when it
can easily be supplied from the context, especially when it is
indefinite, as λώιόν (m 3ώρ ἀποαερεΐσθαε, οστίϊ σίθεν ἀντίον εϊπη it is
better to take away the gifts (of that man) whoever speaks against
you.

1047.	The antecedent is sometimes attracted into the relative
clause. It then agrees in case with the relative.

PREPOSITIONS

1048.	Most prepositions were originally adverbs (chiefly local),
and are often so employed in Homer (without case), as iv but
therein, υπό below, παρὰ by his side.

1049.	They are used both with nouns and verbs, but are often
separated from the words they modify, sometimes following them.
This separation in the case of verbs has been incorrectly named
tmesis (τμησις cutting'), as κρατερον hirl μνθον ετελλεν and he enjoined
a stern command (upon him), where ίπϊ is to be taken with έχελλεν
as part of the verbal idea, καὶ ϊπΐ κνίφαὶ ηλθεν and darkness came
on, where επὶ must be joined with ηλθεν.

1050.	Dissyllabic prepositions regularly have the accent on
the ultima, but in two cases they take the accent on the penult:

1)	When they follow the word modified (with the exception
of ἀμφί>;, ἀνά, αντί, Stet), as ω επι πολλὰ μόγησα for which I Underwent
great toil, θίν εφ' ἀλός upon the shore of the sea.

2)	When a preposition stands for itself compounded with a

ava for the imperative of ἀνίστημι stand up ! up !

1051.	Prepositions are used with the genitive, dative, and
accusative cases; some are used with all three cases, some with
only two, and some with only one.

1052.	They are used to emphasize or to define more clearly
certain case relations. Of course the prepositions do not “ govern
” these cases, but the cases take the prepositions.

1053.	The genitive with prepositions primarily denotes that
from which something proceeds, the dative that in or by which

<pb n="326"/>PREPOSITIONS	[1054-1061

something is or is done, the accusative that toward, over, along, or
upon which motion occurs.

1054.	The primary relations expressed by prepositions are
those of place and time, but they may express cause, origin, agency,
condition, purpose, and various other relations.

1055.	Prepositions are used in forming compound verbs, many
of which, particularly those compounded with cv, «iri, and συν, are
construed with the dative.

1056.	With the genitive alone are used the following :

ἀντὶ instead of	out	of,	from

ἀιτό off, from, away from	ιτρό	before

1057.	And the following, known as improper prepositions :

ἀγχι near, close
aviv without

HOMERIC GREEK

SYNTAX OF THE VERB

1062.	A transitive verb is one whose action passes over to an
object in the accusative, as μήνιν αειΒε sing the wrath, ελίσσετο
Ἀχαιοί^ he kept entreating the Achaeans.

1063.	An intransitive verb is one whose action does not pass
over to an object, as ήλθε he came.

1064.	In verbs with both first and second tenses (first aorist,
second aorist, first perfect, second perfect, etc.), the first tense is
usually transitive (often causative, 1069), the second intransitive.

1065.	The active voice denotes the subject as acting, as νονσον
ἀνα στρατόν ωρσε he kindled a plague up through the camp.

1066.	The passive voice denotes the subject as being acted upon,
as Aios S’ ίτιλείετο βονλή but the will of Zeus was being accomplished.

1067.	In the middle voice the subject is represented as acting:

1)	upon itself, as πείθομαι I persuade myself .{obey), φαίνομαι
I show myself (appear). -

2)	for itself (reflexively), as καλεομαι I call for myself, summon.

3)	upon something belonging to itself, or in which it has a special
interest, as λύομαι I loose my own, ransom.

1068.	It is often difficult to distinguish in translation between
the active and middle, but the action of the middle always has
some reference, either direct or indirect, to the subject, and the
subject has an interest in, or is affected by the action.

1069.	Some verbs are used at times in a causative sense, that is,
the subject causes something to'be done by another, as av S’ αυτήν
ΧρϋσηίΒα βήσομεν let us cause Chryseis to go on board.

1070.	Sometimes the present tense indicates that an action is
only attempted; this is called the conative present, as ἀρννμενος
striving to win.

1071.	When an active verb which takes two accusatives (1020)
becomes passive, the accusative of the thing is retained, while the
accusative of the person becomes the subject, as αναιΒείήν επιειμενε
O thou clothed in shamelessness!

1072.	The tenses denote time of action and kind of action.

<pb n="328"/>SYNTAX OP THE VERB, GENERAL [1073-1085

1073.	The time of action is indicated by the tenses only in the
indicative.

1074.	The present is denoted by the present tense, and by the
perfect.

1075.	The past is denoted by the imperfect, aorist, and
pluperfect. The future is denoted by the future and the future
perfect.

1076.	Continued or repeated action is denoted by the present,
the imperfect, and (occasionally) the future.

1077.	Completed action denoting a permanent state is indicated
by the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect.

1078.	Action that simply takes place is indicated by the aorist
and (sometimes) the future.

1079.	The imperfect denotes the continuance of action in past
time, customary or repeated action, as ίλνον, I loosed, was loosing,
kept loosing, was accustomed to loose.

1080.	The aorist indicative denotes the simple occurrence of an
action in past time, as ίλνσα I loosed, did loose.

1081.	Inceptive aorist: The aorist of verbs denoting a state or a
condition, or continued action, usually denotes the entrance into
the state, or the beginning of the action, as ϊ8άκρνσ·ε he 'fell to
weeping.

■	1082.	The aorist is often used to express a general truth. It is

then called a gnomic aorist, and is considered a primary tense, as
os «e ihots ίπίπείθηται, μάλα τ’ ϊκΧνον αντον whoever obeys the gods,
him they especially hear.

1083.	The future ordinarily denotes that an action will take
place later; but may express desire or a command.

1084.	The perfect regularly denotes a state or a condition
(usually as the result of completed action), arid should be translated
by the present, as προβίβονλα I prefer, ἀμφιβέβηκας (who)
dost protect.

Moods

1085.	The adverbs av and κί(ν) are often used to qualify the
meaning of the moods ; they are used in two ways:

<pb n="329"/>1086-1093]

HOMERIC GREEK

1)	In independent clauses they are used with the subjunctive,
the optative, and with the past and future tenses of the indicative;
and also with the participle and infinitive, when they represent
the independent indicative and optative.

2)	In dependent clauses, usually with the subjunctive.

1086.	These adverbs usually give a touch of indefiniteness to
the clause in which they stand. They have no exact equivalent
in English. When they appear in the conclusion of conditional
sentences, they are usually translated by could, or would, in
English.

1087.	The subjunctive with these adverbs is used almost the
same as the future indicative, or the potential optative (1105).

1088.	They are used in simple sentences and in the apodosis
(conclusion) of complex sentences to express limitation by circumstances
or conditions.

1089.	They are regularly found in final clauses referring to the
future.

1090.	They are usually found in conditional clauses in the
optative and in the subjunctive, when the governing verb is
future, or in a mood which implies futurity.

1091.	They are not ordinarily used in conditional, relative,
and temporal clauses with the subjunctive in comparisons and
similes, or when they refer to events which occur repeatedly or
at an indefinite time, or when they refer to sayings which have a
general application.

The Moods in Simple Sentences

The Independent Indicative without αν or κε'(ν)

1092.	Without v or κί(ν) the indicative mood simply states a
fact, either positively or negatively, asks a question, or makes an
exclamation.

1093.	An unattainable wish which refers to the present or to
the past is expressed by a past tense of the indicative with aWe
(ΰθε), or d γὰρ ; the negative is μη.

<pb n="330"/>MOODS IN SIMPLE SENTENCES [1094-1104

1094.	To express an unattainable wish, Φφελον ought is used
with the present infinitive to denote present time and continued
past action, or with the aorist infinitive to denote past time.

The Independent Indicative with ἀν on κί(ν)

1095.	The aorist (and sometimes the imperfect) indicative is
used with ἀν or kc'(v) to denote past possibility, probability, necessity,
or a cautious statement.

1096.	The past tenses of the indicative may be used with ἀν
or k«(v) to denote unreality.

1097.	av or kI(v) may be used with the future indicative with
a conditional or limiting meaning.

The Independent Subjunctive without £Lv ok κε(ν)

1098.	The subjunctive without ἀν or kc(v) is used in the first
person, present and aorist, to express a desire or a request (hortatory
subjunctive), as τινὰ μάντιν Ιρείομεν let us ask some seer.

1099.	The aorist subjunctive is used in the second and third

persons (and' sometimes in the first) with μη in prohibitions, as
μη σε κιχήω let me not come upon you.,	■ , . , ;	,

1100.	The present and aorist subjunctive are used in the first
person (rarely in the third) in deliberative questions as to what
may be done advantageously or with propriety.

1101.	Thd subjunctive is frequently used as nearly the equivalent
ofv the future indicative, and refers to some future event.
It is usually qualified by ἀν or xe(v), and the negative is ov.

The Independent Optative without αν on ne(v)

1102.	The independent optative without ἀν or κε(ν) is used to
express a wish that something may happen, as νμΐν θεοὶ δοΐεν may
the gods grant to you.

1103 The potential optative (1105), which regularly takes ἀν
or kc(v), is occasionally found without either.

1104.	The optative is employed at times to express a command,
a request, or an exhortation, being practically equivalent
to the imperative.

<pb n="331"/>1105-1108]

HOMERIC GREEK

The Independent Optative with αν or κί(ν)

1105.	With £v or κί(ν) the optative is used to express a future
action as dependent upon circumstances or conditions. This is
called the potential optative, and is usually to be translated by
might, could, would, etc.

The Imperative

1106.	The imperative expresses a command, or a request; the
negative is μη.

The Infinitive

1107.	1) The only tenses which occur in the infinitive are the
present, future, aorist, perfect, and future perfect. The middle
and passive differ in form in the aorist only.

2)	In the subjunctive, optative, imperative, and infinitive, the
tenses do not of themselves indicate time.

3)	The present in these moods denotes an action simply as
continued.

4)	The aorist denotes an action simply as brought to pass.

5)	The perfect denotes an action simply as completed.

6)	The subject of an infinitive is usually in the accusative,
but may be omitted when it is the subject of the leading verb, or
its direct or indirect object.

7)	The infinitive may be the subject of a verb, especially an
impersonal one, or ίστί(ν).

8)	It may be the object of a verb, especially verbs indicating
wish, command, advice, consent, attempt,'and the like.

9)	The infinitive may depend upon adjectives or substantives,
especially those denoting ability, fitness, willingness, or have a
similar meaning to verbs which take the infinitive (1107, 7).

10)	The infinitive also may express purpose; the negative is μη.

11)	The infinitive is used also to express a command with the
nominative of the second person,- or with the accusative of the
third person'" for the subject if expressed; the subject may be
omitted. In this usage it is the equivalent of the imperative.

The Participle

1108.	The participle has only the present, future, aorist, perfect,
and future perfect tenses. It is used attributively as an

<pb n="332"/>MOODS IN SIMPLE SENTENCES [1109-1113

adjective to modify a noun, or the noun may be omitted and the
participle (usually with the pronoun, δ, -η, το) may be used as a substantive.
Such participles usually indicate time present, past, or
future relatively to the time of the main verb.

Note 1. — The aorist participle may denote time contemporaneous
with the action of the main verb, as μειδιμτάσα «δέκατο κύνελλον she look
Hie cup with a smile.

Note 2.— On the other hand, the present participle may express time
previous to the action of the main verb, as Χρϋσριδα εϊσεν ἀγων leading
Chryseis on board he seated her.

1109.	The participle may express :

1)	Time, as τοΐσι S’ ἀνιστάμενος μετέφη ἀχιλλευς when lie had
risen.among them Achilles addressed them.

2)	Cause.

3)	Manner or means.

4)	Condition.

5)	Purpose or desire (usually the future participle), as λΰσό-
μενος θνγατρα (idesiring) to ransom his own daughter; μαχησόμενο%
{desiring) to fight, for the purpose of fighting.

6)	Concession, as ἀλόχω περ εονσg even though you are my ivife.

7)	Attendant circumstance.

1110.	The Greek often employs a participle where we should
use a relative clause, as θεοὶ Όλνμτηα 8ώματ’ εχοντες the gods who
have Olympian homes.

1111.	A noun and a participle, not closely connected grammatically
with the rest of the sentence, may stand by themselves in the
genitive in the construction known as the genitive absolute. See 994.

1112.	This construction arose from the use of the genitive
modified by a participle, where the genitive was dependent upon
some word in the main construction of the sentence, and many
cases are on the border line between the absolute and the dependent
’ constructions.

COMPOUND SENTENCES

1113.	Asyndeton, or the omission of conjunctions between independent
elements of a sentence, is often used to mark lively and
rapid descriptions.

<pb n="383"/>1114-1124]

HOMERIC GREEK

1114.	Parataxis, or coordination, was often employed where
one would expect a subordinate construction. 1028, note.

SUBORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONS
Purpose Clauses

1115.	Clauses which denote purpose or final clauses are intro-

duced by the final particles is, στ (π) ως, ΐνα, όφρα, «os; the negative
is μη.	Γ

1116.	Purpose clauses take the subjunctive after primary (816)
tenses, the optative (occasionally the subjunctive) after secondary
tenses.

1117.	The subjunctive sometimes takes ἀν or κέ(ν), especially
with is, οπ(π)ωs, and οφρα.

Object Clauses

1118.	The two main types of object clauses are :

1)	Object clauses with verbs of effort.

2)	Object clauses with verbs of fear.

1119.	ό·!Ί-(7Γ)ως (sometimes os and fva) is used to introduce object
clauses with verbs of effort. These clauses take the future
indicative after both primary and secondary tenses (816). The
negative is μή.

/1120. With verbs of effort object clauses may take the con-
/struction of purpose clauses, with οπ(π)ως and the subjunctive or
optative.

1121.	With verbs of caution negative object clauses take the
construction of clauses with verbs of effort or with verbs of fear.

1122.	With verbs of effort, object clauses may take the subjunctive
with ἀν after οπ(π)ωϊ, and sometimes after ί>ς.

1123.	With verbs meaning to consider, plan, try, the subjunctive
with or without κί(ν), or the optative is used. These object
clauses do not take the future indicative.

1124.	The subjunctive, optative, or the future indicative, with
οπ(π)ως (5π(π)ως μη in the negative) may follow verbs of will or
desire, instead of the infinitive which is the usual construction
after these verbs.

<pb n="334"/>SUBORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONS [1125-1133

Object Clauses after Verbs of Feak

1125.	With verbs of fear, which refer to the future, object
clauses have the subjunctive after primary tenses, and the opta^
tive (sometimes the subjunctive) after secondary tenses (816).

1126.	With μη or 0π(π)ωϊ μη, the subjunctive or optative may
be used to indicate a possible object of fear. The aorist subjunctive
may refer to past time, as δεδοικα μη σε mpd-rry I fear
lest she has beguiled you.

1127.	The indicative with μη (μη ον in the negative) is used to
express fear which refers to the present or past time. The
aorist is employed in this construction.

Causal Clauses

1128.	Causal clauses are introduced by on, kmt, ίπειή, ore, 3, ·

o re, οπ(7τ)άτ€, οὐνίκα, ως, and εὖτε.

1129.	Causal clauses which denote a fact regularly have the
indicative after both primary and secondary tenses.

1130.	Causal clauses which denote an alleged or a supposed
reason have the optative after secondary tenses.

Result Clauses (Consecutive Clauses)

1131.	Clauses of result are introduced by various words, some
of the most common being ώστε, ως, otos, οσ(σ)ος.

1132.	These clauses may employ either the infinitive or the
finite verb:

1)	The infinitive is used to indicate an anticipated, natural, or
possible result; the negative is μη.

2)	When the finite verb is used, any form of the simple
sentence may be employed. The indicative (especially in the
aorist) is the form most commonly used, denoting the actual
result of the action of the principal verb; the negative is ov.

Conditional Clauses

1133.	A conditional sentence regularly consists of two principal
elements:

1) The condition, denoting a supposed or assumed (if) case,
called the protasis.

<pb n="335"/>1134-1142]

HOMERIC GREEK

2) The conclusion, denoting what follows if the condition is
realized, called the apodosis.

1134.	d and at are used to introduce conditional clauses, in the
indicative and optative.

1135.	d ἀν, d (at) ««(r), rjv are used to introduce conditional
clauses in the subjunctive.

1136.	In the conclusion ἀν or k£(v) is employed with the optative
to indicate possibility, and with the past tenses of the indicative
to indicate the unfulfillment of the condition, or repetition.

1137.	The negative of the condition is μη ; of the conclusion it
is ov when the conclusion is considered a fact if the condition be
true.

1138.	Present unreal conditional sentences have ei with the
optative in the condition, and ἀν with the optative in the conclusion.

1139.	Past
unreal conditional sentences have the aorist or
imperfect indicative in the condition, and in the conclusion either
the aorist or imperfect indicative with ἀν or κί(ν), or the present
or aorist optative with ἀν or κί(ν). The imperfect of unreal conditions
represents past time.

.1140. More vivid future conditions have:

1)	d ἀν,ην with the subjunctive in the condition, and in the conclusion
either the future indicative or some other form referring
to future time.

2)	The subjunctive with κί(ν) in both condition and conclusion.

3)	(Rarely) d (αϊ), κί(ν) with the future in the condition.

1141.	Less vivid future conditions have d κέ(ν), d ἀν, with the
optative in the condition, and in the conclusion may have
the present indicative, the simple future indicative, the future
indicative with κί{ν), the hortatory subjunctive, the subjunctive
with ἀν or κί(ν), or the optative, with the same force as the
optative with ἀν or tce(v).

1142.	Present general conditions have ἀν (ην) with the subjunctive
in the condition, and the present indicative or its equivalent
in the conclusion.

<pb n="836"/>SUBORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONS [1143-1153

1143.	Past general conditions have d with the optative in. the
condition, and the imperfect indicative or its equivalent in the
conclusion.

1144.	Ordinary relative clauses, which define more closely a
definite antecedent, have the constructions of other simple
sentences, except κε'(ν) or ἀν may he used with the future.

1145.	Relative clauses of purpose have the subjunctive (usually
with j/)) after primary tenses, and the optative after secondary
tenses, although the future indicative may be used.

1146.	More vivid future conditional relative clauses have the
subjunctive, usually with av or κί(ν), and sometimes the future
with ἀν or kc(v).

1147.	Less vivid future conditional relative clauses have the
optative with av or xe(v) in the main clause, and sometimes have
av or κί(γ) with the optative in the relative clause.

1148.	Present generalizing relative clauses usually have av or
κί(ν) with the subjunctive in the. relative clause, or the present
indicative or an equivalent in the main clause.

1149.	Past generalizing relative clauses have the optative in
the relative clause, and the imperfect indicative or its equivalent
in the main clause.

Temporal Clauses

1150.	Temporal clauses are introduced by the temporal conjunctions
ore, όπ(ιτ)ότε, eos. evre, ij/eos, σπ(π)ωί, όφρα; erret, επειδή, e£
(άφ’) οὐ ; ets δτε (*e(r)), eis δ (κε(ν)).

1151.	Temporal clauses which refer to the future or to indefinite
present time have the subjunctive with av or κί(ν).

1152.	Temporal clauses which refer to future time have av or
kc(v) with the optative in the temporal clause, and may have the
future indicative, or the subjunctive with av or κε'(ν) in the main
clause.

Indirect Questions

1153.	Indirect questions keep the mood and tense of direct
questions, after primary tenses (the indicative, the past indicative
with av, the deliberative subjunctive, or the potential optative with

<pb n="337"/>1154-1158]

HOMEEIC GREEK

ἀν or κε(ν)). After secondary tenses they may keep the mood and
tense of direct questions, but generally change to the optative.

Indirect Discourse

1154.	The kind of the leading verb or expression in a sentence
involving indirect discourse determines the construction:

1)	Verbs of saying have either the infinitive or a 5n (0>s) clause.

2)	Verbs of thinking and believing usually take the infinitive.

3)	Verbs of knowing, learning, perceiving, hearing, showing,
and the like, usually have the participle, but may have a on (!>s)
clause.

1155.	Clauses in indirect discourse introduced by on or i>s, after
primary tenses keep the mood and tense of the direct form unchanged.

1156.	Indicatives
and subjunctives without ἀν or κί(ν) usually
become optative after secondary tenses, but may remain unchanged.

1157.	Subordinate
verbs after primary tenses keep their original
mood and tense.

1158.	The optative is not employed in indirect discourse,
except in indirect questions (1153). After both primary and
secondary tenses in principal clauses, the same past tense is used
that would have been employed in an independent clause, from
the speaker’s point of view. After the secondary tenses the
future is generally represented by ίμολλον with the infinitive.

<pb n="338"/>IV. PROSODY

Rules of Quantity, the Hexameter

1159.	Every vowel which has the circumflex accent is long (537).

1160.	The vowel of the ultima in every word having the
circumflex on the penult is short (545).

1161.	If a long penult has the acute accent, then the ultima
must be long also.

1162.	If the ultima is short and the penult has the acute accent,
then the penult must be short also.

1163.	If the antepenult has the accent, the vowel of the ultima
must be short (544).

1164.	Exceptions to these rules are to be found only in the
cases of the diphthongs αι and οι, when final, which are then considered
short (except in the optative and οἴκοι) for the purpose of
accent but must be counted long when marking the feet of the
verse (547).

1165.	Apparent exceptions to these rules are to he found in the
case of certain classes of compounds, as ovre, /xr^rt, owns, /xym, rj^t,
oiSe, aide, toixtoc, τάσδε, etc., where the primary form is accented
without considering the following enclitic as an integral part of
the word.

1166.	Most exceptions to the rules of quantity are only apparent.

1167.	If
an apparently short final syllable stands where a long
one is expected, it is probable that :

1)	The pause of the caesuia (1185) or diaeresis (1188) fills out
the time required for the foot, allowing the same freedom as at
the end of a verse, or

2)	The following word has lost an initial consonant (usually p,
sometimes σ), which would have made the preceding syllable long
by position.

<pb n="839"/>1168-1177]

HOMERIC GREEK

1168.	Short syllables ending in a single consonant are occasionally
lengthened in thesis (the accented or ictus-syllable), although
the next word begins with a vowel.

Special Rules for Determining the Length of Syllables by their
Position in Hexameter

1169.	If a long syllable is followed by a short, then the next
syllable must be short also.

1170.	If a short syllable is followed by a long, then the preceding
syllable must be short also.

1171.	The first syllable of each foot must be long, and is to be
given slightly more stress than the other half of the foot.

1172.	When a word ends in a short vowel (and sometimes the
diphthongs at and oi), and the next word begins with a vowel,
the final vowel of the first word is regularly elided (575).

1173.	When a word ends hi a long vowel or a diphthong and
the next word begins with a vowel, the long final vowel or diphthong
is regularly shortened.

Note. — Sometimes a long vowel or diphthong is shortened when
followed by a vowel within the same word.

1174.	If a word ends in a short vowel and the next word
originally began with vau (^), elision ordinarily does not take
place (580).

1175.	If a word ends in a long vowel or a diphthong and the
next word originally began with a vau ('f), the long final vowel
or diphthong ordinarily remains long.

1176.	If a word ends in a long vowel or a diphthong and has
the verse-accent on it, the long vowel or diphthong may remain
long, even though the next word begins with a vowel.

1177.	When a word ending in . a vowel is followed by a word
beginning with a vowel, the result is hiatus. Hiatus is ordinarily
avoided in poetry either 1) by elision; 2) by the use of
movable consonants, 561-563; 3) by the shortening of a final long
vowel or diphthong, 1173; 4) by crasis or synizesis, 586-587.

<pb n="340"/>PROSODY, RULES OF QUANTITY [1178-1188

1178.	Hiatus may be allowed 1) when there is a distinct pause
in sense (diaeresis or caesura 1185-1189) between the vowels
which produce it; 2) when the verse-accent (ictus) falls on the
long vowel or diphthong which is followed by another vowel;

3)	when elision has. already taken place; 4) after i or u; 5) when
a long vowel or diphthong is shortened (weak or improper hiatus).

1179.	The metre of the Homeric poems is the dactylic (sometimes
called the heroic) hexameter, the most common of all Greek verse.

1180.	There are six feet to the verse, the first five being either
dactyls (that is, one long followed by two shorts — w w), or its

equivalent, the spondee (that is, two longs---). The sixth foot

is always a spondee.

1181.	In dactylic hexameter the ictus (verse accent) is always
on the first syllable of each foot.

1182.	The fifth foot is usually a dactyl, only about one verse in
twenty having a spondee in this place, which gives the verse a
movement slower than usual. It is then called a spondaic verse.

1183.	In each foot one part is distinguished from the other by
a slight stress of voice, called the ictus.

1184.	The final syllable of a verse may be either long or short,
hut as there is a slight pause here, the final syllable in hexameter
is always considered long, making the last foot of the verse always
a spondee, 1180.

1185.	Whenever a word ends within a foot, it is called caesura.
If this coincides with a pause in the verse, it is called the caesura
of the verse. The caesura is employed with great skill in
the Homeric poems to make the verse more melodious and to aid
in its recital.

1186.	There is almost always a caesura in the third foot. It
occurs either after the first syllable of the foot, or else between
the two short syllables.

1187.	The pause after the first syllable is called the masculine
caesura, that after the second the feminine.

1188.	Whenever the end of a word coincides with the end of
a foot, it is called diaeresis. When this falls with a pause, it is
called the diaeresis of the verse.

<pb n="341"/>1189-1192]

HOMERIC GREEK

1189.	The most important diaeresis is the one which comes at
the end of the fourth foot. From its common employment in
pastoral poetry it is called the bucolic diaeresis.

1190.	For metrical purposes all vowels and syllables of Greek
words may be divided into long and short.

1191.	The rhythm of Greek verse is based upon the regular
succession of long and short syllables.

1192.	To obtain facility in reading the verse, a considerable
quantity of it should .be memorized, special attention being paid
to the quantity (that is, twice as much time should be given to
each long syllable as to a short), and the pauses should be carefully
observed. Although English verse is primarily accentual
rather than quantitative, still the memorizing of a few lines of
English dactylic hexameter (Longfellow’s “ Evangeline,”1 for
example, mediocre though it be) will materially aid in getting the
swing and the movement of the Greek hexameter.

1 This is the forest primaeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,

Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.
