PROFOUND SCHOLAR
SYMPATHETIC AND INSPIRING TEACHER
LOVER OF HOMER
AND OF ALL THINGS TRUE AND

BEAUTIFUL
<pb/>PREFACE</p>

<p>This book, now offered to the public, is the fruit of seven years
of experimentation and of much counsel with those interested in
the plan which it embodies.</p>

<p>It has already gone through four mimeographed editions, and
has been used for several years: in Ohio Wesleyan University,
in Oberlin College, and in Southwestern Presbyterian University.
In all these cases it has had marked success in creating and sustaining
interest in beginning Greek, where the crux of the whole
problem of the future of Hellenic studies lies.</p>

<p>The reasons which have conyinced the author of the necessity
for basing the work of beginners on Homeric instead of on Attic
Greek will be found in a paper, entitled “A Year—or more —
of Greek,” published in the Classical Journal for February, 1918,
and in a second paper, “Homer and the Study of Greek,” which
is printed in this book, following the table of contents. To all
who may be interested in the subject, from the standpoint of
humanistic studies, the author would heartily commend the reading
of Andrew Lang’s delightful little essay, “Homer and the Study
of Greek,” published in his collection of Essays in Little.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be hoped that a book of this kind, which seeks to
establish a new path to our common goal, will be so free from minor
errors as would one along the old established lines. Hence the
author will be profoundly grateful to those who will be generous
enough to make suggestions looking toward the betterment of the
work as well as to those who will be kind enough to point out any
errors. Naturally, in a work of this nature, there is the constantly
recurring problem of how to reconcile most successfully effective
pedagogy and scientific accuracy of statement.</p>

<p>The book does not pretend to be a text where the advanced
Homeric scholar will find catalogued every stray Homeric form, or

v
<pb/>

supposedly Homeric form, but its first object is to teach beginners
to read Greek intelligently and with pleasure.</p>

<p>It is not intended that the ordinary student shall master all the
grammar found in this text: much of it is for reference only. But
certainly every teacher should have at least this much Homeric
grammar thoroughly at command and be overflowing with it, not,
however, to the extent of attempting to teach all of it. The prime
object of first year work, as so admirably stated by Prof. Gildersleeve, 
is “a maximum of forms, a minimum of syntax, and early
acquaintance with Greek in the mass.” To gain this object, it
is necessary to read, read, read Greek.</p>

<p>In the paradigms and vocabularies, both simple and compound
forms of verbs are used to supplement each other, and a free use
of analogy is employed, as is commonly done in books of this
kind. In the verbal forms, the augment is regularly supplied when
missing. t</p>

<p>Those opposed to the employment of prose sentences in Homeric
language will find it easy to omit these; but the author is convinced
that a better grasp of Homeric forms can be secured by
their use.</p>

<p>After this book is completed successfully, any one of several
roads is open for a continuation of the Greek course:

(1) Probably the most satisfactory method is to continue for
some time with Homer, reading copious extracts from the Iliad
and Odyssey. The student is now well prepared to handle successfully
the standard school editions of these.

(2) The passage from Homer to the Attic Drama is an easy one,
and is the most satisfactory introduction to the Attic dialect.
This is the course which the author would strongly recommend, as
most likely to be of the greatest value and as having probably the
strongest appeal to the most students. Euripides furnishes the
easiest reading, and several of his plays have been published in
convenient form with vocabularies (Longmans, Green and Co.),
and with both vocabularies and notes (Macmillan and Co.). This
could be followed by any one of several possibilities, some more
drama, Plato, or the New Testament.

vi
<pb/>PREFACE

(3) Some Herodotus could now be read with not much difficulty,
and his work would admirably supplement the Homeric stories.

(4) It is quite possible to read some Plato now, using a good
edition of one of the dialogues, with vocabulary and notes, such as
that of Seymour and Dyer.

(5) Many will find a strong appeal in the Lyric Poets, which
are very easy after a fair amount of Homer and contain some of the
choicest gems in all Greek literature.

(6) Some may want to read Hesiod, who is the easiest of all
authors after Homer. His' importance has not always been
recognized, and he has been entirely too much neglected in our
colleges.

(7) The New Testament could be studied to good advantage
after Homer, and is recommended to those intending to enter the
ministry.

(8) Those who are wedded to Xenophon, who teach him with
success, and who feel that he must come early in the course, will
find Homer a much better preparation for Xenophon than Xenophon
is for Homer. There are a number of good school editions,
and students can now read rapidly considerable quantities of the
Anabasis, or of any of the other works of Xenophon.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, the teacher should of course select
the author in which he has the greatest interest and for which he
has the most enthusiasm. He will find the work not only much
easier, but more successful as well.</p>

<p>To all who have assisted, directly or indirectly, in the production
of the present book, the author would here express his sincerest
appreciation and gratitude. Lack of space prevents giving a
complete list of names, but the author feels that special mention
is due to Prof. Francis G. Allinson of Brown University, for generously
reading the whole of the manuscript and for making many
helpful suggestions; to Prof. Samuel E. Bassett of the University
of Vermont, and to Prof. Edward Fitch of Hamilton College, who
also went over the manuscript and made many valuable criticisms ;
to Prof. Walter Petersen of Bethany College, whose help on a number
of grammatical problems has been invaluable; to Miss Mabel

<pb/></p>

<p>Drennan of the Swanton, Ohio, High School, for making the whole
of the two general vocabularies; to Prof. Shirley Smith of Oberlin
College and Mr. Joseph Adameç, graduate student at Yale, for
checking up the vocabulary; to Mr. W. J. Millard, student at
Southwestern Presbyterian University, for verifying the Biblical
quotations; to Prof. Wilmot Haines Thompson of Acadia University,
for reading the manuscript, making a number of valuable suggestions,
and for much valuable assistance in reading proof; to Prof.
Leigh Alexander of Oberlin College, who has generously placed
at the disposal of the author the results of two years of experience
with the book in his classes, who has read all the proof and has
saved the book from a number of errors; to the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, for the loan of some unusually fine photographs for
illustrations; to D. C. Heath and Co., for the use of illustrations from
Webster’s Ancient History, one of their texts; to Prof. Frank E.
Robbins of the University of Michigan, and to the Classical
Journal, for permission to use Prof. Robbins’s valuable statistics
on Greek verb forms, which appeared in the Classical Journal,
15, 2; to Dr. Alice Braunlich of the Davenport High School, to
Prof. G. B. Waldrop of the Westminster School, and to Dr. D. W.
Abercrombie, recently of Worcester Academy, for help in reading
the proof; and to the J. S. Cushing Company (The Norwood
Press) for their very careful and painstaking typographical work.</p>

<p>If this book will contribute to the value and interest of the study
of beginning Greek, the author will feel that his seven years of
work upon it have not been spent in vain. The time has come
when lovers of the humanities everywhere must join hands in
the promotion of the common cause. If anything seems to be of
mutual advantage, we must first test it carefully and then hold
fast to it if we find it good. Then, to all teachers of Greek and
every true friend of humanistic studies and of culture in its best
sense, the author would say in conclusion:

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</p>

<p>In an article entitled “A Year—or more— of Greek,” contributed
to the February, 1918, number of the Classical Journal,
the author sets forth a few of the more important reasons why
the present system of teaching beginners in Greek should be
revised to meet modern conditions. The sum and substance of
the article was a plea for the abandonment of Xenophon for beginning
work, something which should have been done years ago,
and the substitution of Homer in his place. The paper embodied
the results of several years of experimentation; and the primary
reason urged for the change was based on the comparative literary
value of the two authors and their appeal to beginning students.
As we view the situation to-day, we are compelled to confess that
in the hands of the average teacher, when applied to the average
student, Xenophon and all his works are all too often found to be
tedious and dreary. This leaves out of count the exceptional
teacher, who has large and enthusiastic classes in the Anabasis
year after year, for such teachers could make any subject fascinating.
Homer on the other hand possesses those qualities which
make him especially interesting, as well as of permanent value, to
the majority of students who still take Greek.</p>

<p>In this connection the author may be permitted to quote from
the article just mentioned:1 “The reasons which make Homer
so desirable are apparent when once the question is seriously
considered. His work is homogeneous in vocabulary, in literary
style and idioms employed, and in metrical form; so that when
students once get a fair start in him, further progress becomes
easier and more accelerated. He employs all three persons, with
all modes and tenses of the verb, so that all forms that are learned

1 C. J. 13, 5.</p>

<p>XXIX
<pb/>

are used enough to be kept fresh in the students’ mind and do not
have to be learned again when they begin anything which is in
dialogue form. His vocabulary is fairly limited, enough so in
fact that it does not present any special difficulty to the beginner.
His sentences are short, simple, and clear-cut, having none of the
involved structure which makes so much of Xenophon really too
difficult for first-year work. The verse, which has been considered
a bar, is an actual help, as it is quite easily learned and is a marked
aid in memorizing considerable portions of Greek, which is important
at this stage. Furthermore, the rules of quantity are a
considerable help in simplifying and illustrating the principles of
accent. As he uses only one type of verse, and that the simplest
— the dactylic hexameter — the ordinary student usually becomes
quite adept at reading this before the end of the first year’s work.

“The prose composition for the first year’s work may be based
upon Homer, the students using Homeric forms and constructions,
without knowing of the existence of any other kind. This may be
done without the slightest fear of blunting their sense of discrimination
between poetic and prose diction and style, a sense
which cannot possibly be developed until they have had several
years’ work and have read a considerable amount of Greek in both
prose and poetry. Homer is so straightforward and simple in
what he has to say, with nothing obscure, mystical, or far-fetched
in any way, that he is quite intelligible to the average high-school
freshman; and at the same time he possesses the qualities of high
literary art in such a marked degree that he appeals strongly to
the oldest and most advanced members of any college class.

"Furthermore, Homer is the best possible preparation for all
later Greek literature, much of which is unintelligible without
a fair knowledge of him. He was to Greek literature what the
Bible has been to English, and a great deal more as well. He leads
us somewhere, not merely into a blind alley as does Xenophon,
both with reference to later Greek literature and to much of the
best in later European literature as well, where his influence has
been incalculable and perhaps greater than that of any other
single writer. In him are the germs of so many things. We have

xiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

the narrative highly developed, the beginning of the drama,
oratory, statecraft, seamanship, war, adventure, and religion —
in fact, life as it was to the old Greeks in its manifold aspects.

“ Then the student who has taken only a very little of beginning
Greek, even if he has progressed no farther than the end of the
first book of the Iliad, has come into vital contact with the magic
and the music of the Greek language, used in one of the most
beautiful, one of the most varied, and one of the most influential
literary compositions of all ages; and though he may have devoted
considerable labor to mining the gold, he cannot, truthfully say,
and probably will not want to say, that Greek for him has been a
waste of time.”</p>

<p>To begin the study of Greek with Homer, it would be necessary
to substitute Homeric for Attic Greek for the work of the first year:
the student would be taught Homeric forms and constructions as a
basis for future work, and would devote to the study of Homer
the time which is now occupied by Xenophon. It is the purpose
of the present paper to develop more in detail some of the most
important reasons which make such a change not only desirable
but imperative if Greek is to be saved as a vital factor in our educational
system.</p>

<p>The idea of such a plan first suggested itself to the writer several
years ago, when, full of boundless enthusiasm for his subject
and for all things Greek, he was attempting to teach first-year
work and Xenophon, and was compelled to admit to himself that
his efforts were not meeting noth what might be called success.
Too many good students refused to take Greek in the first place,
and of those who did enlist, too many, even of the better ones, were
discouraged by the unending round of grammatical forms, leading
up to an author whose works are not of a nature to fire the imagination
and stir the hearts in the breasts of our youth, as can be,
and is, done by the great masterpieces of Hellas such as the Iliad
and the Odyssey.</p>

<p>The writer would like to make it plain that he is not a hater of
Xenophon, but that he greatly enjoyed his first year of Greek,
taken in the old way, as well as his Xenophon, later. The same

<pb/>

is probably true of most classical scholars. This goes a long way
toward explaining why they are now teaching Greek and Latin
instead of sociology or mechanical engineering. It would be distinctly
misleading however for those who have a special taste
for linguistic work and who enjoyed reading the production of
such authors as Caesar and Xenophon to infer therefrom that
their case is at all typical of the mass of students who take these
subjects. Although the description in Andrew Lang’s essay,
“Homer and the Study of Greek,” is probably too highly colored,
the account that he gives of his own experience and that of his
fellows in the study of beginning Greek and Xenophon ought to
have a lesson and a warning for every one who is still a friend of
the classics. He makes it quite plain that they found Xenophon
anything but inspiring, and that most of them thoroughly hated
him, an experience of many good students, which is too common
to be ignored.</p>

<p>It is only fair to state that although this idea of beginning Greek
with the reading of Homer is original with the writer, it is not
new. This was the regular method employed by the old Romans
in teaching their boys Greek, and it was highly commended by
that capable and judicious old schoolmaster, Quintilian, as the
best possible plan. Since that time it has been used now and then
by some of the world’s ablest educators and scholars. It was thus
that Joseph Scaliger (de la Scala), one of the most brilliant
names in the whole history of classical scholarship, taught himself
Greek at Paris; and many more of the great scholars of the past
learned their Greek through Homer. It was tried also by Herbart,
who began a series of experiments in Switzerland, in 1797, where he
employed this method with marked success in private tutoring.
Later he continued his experiments on a larger scale in the teachers’
training college at Koenigsberg, with such good results that he
was thoroughly convinced that this was the only suitable method
of teaching beginning Greek. At his suggestion it was tried by
Dissen, by Ferdinand Ranke, and by Hummel, all of whom were
hearty in its praise; and, most important of all, by Ahrens, at
Hanover, where it was used for thirty years (1850-1881), with

great success, but was finally abandoned because of the lack of
suitable text books and because of the opposition of other Gymnasia
which refused to adopt such a revolutionary plan. It has also
been recommended occasionally, but without success, by other
scholars and humanists, notably by Goethe, by Andrew Lang,
and by Wilamowitz, in Europe; while in America it has been
advocated in one form or another by Seymour, Bolling, Shorey,
Lane Cooper, and others. But hitherto no systematic series of
text books has been issued which are so well adapted to carry the
students through Homer and introduce them to Attic Greek as the
ones which have been worked out in connection with Xenophon.
It has become highly important that this lack be supplied, if possible,
in order that this plan, which has been tried by several
with such good success, may be tested on a wider scale, so that we
may see whether or no it will succeed in the hands of the average
teacher of beginning Greek. Thus students should be prepared
to strike immediately into the heart of Greek literature, instead
of having to go a long way around, as at present.</p>

<p>As to the superiority of Homer over Xenophon, from the standpoint
of literary values, and of interest for the average student,
there can be no quarrel. It remains for us to investigate the
relative advantages and demerits of each as mediums for teaching
the language.</p>

<p>In the first place it is essential that we disabuse our minds of the
once prevalent notion, long since exploded, but still more or less
consciously held by many, that the Attic dialect is the norm by
which all other Greek is to be judged. The language of Homer is
earlier and naturally differs from it in many essentials; therefore
it was long maintained that Homeric Greek is irregular, crude and
unfinished. Hellenistic Greek, which represents a later development
of the language, has its differences; therefore Hellenistic
Greek must be degenerate. Such an idea is utterly unscientific
and ignores completely the modern historical point of view of the
development and growth of languages. Any period which has
given birth to literary productions of surpassing merit and artistic
excellence is justified by its own works; it contains its own lin-

xvii
<pb/>HOMEEIC GKEEK

guistic standards, and will richly repay those who take the trouble
to study it. To call Homeric Greek anomalous and irregular,
because it differs in some particulars from the Attic dialect, is as
misleading as it would be to say that the language of Shakespeare
is immature and eccentric because he does not write the same type
of English as does George Ade or Stephen Leacock. As a matter
of fact, the language of the Homeric poems is quite as finished, has
quite as many virtues, and is quite as much of a norm for its
period and style of composition as Xenophon is for his; and the
different forms in Homer are no more aberrations on his part than
those of Xenophon are marks of degeneracy for him. And Attic
Greek, after all, is but one of a number of dialects, coming at neither
end but in the middle of the development of the Greek language.
It is rarely found pure in any of the great authors, and in none
which are suitable for beginners.</p>

<p>According to our present system, students are taught a smattering
of Attic Greek. Then they are given a smattering of Homer,
who represents a period several centuries earlier. Then again
comes some more Attic Greek, and if the student continues in his
work he usually gets some Doric, with sometimes a little Lesbian,
and the Ionic of Herodotus, to which is commonly added a dash
of the Koine for further confusing variety. All of this comes at
such times and at such points in his development that it is practically
impossible for the ordinary student to obtain a clear conception
of what the Greek language is like and what are the fundamental
processes of its development. As a result grammar becomes
a nightmare to be dreaded instead of an opportunity to study the
structure of one of the most interesting and instructive languages
in existence. This has reference to the linguistic features, apart
from its literary value. If on the other hand we begin with Homer
and obtain a good grounding in his language, the transition from
that to later Greek is simple and natural and in accordance with
well-established laws, so that a student who once gets a grasp
of the processes involved not only has acquired a valuable scientific
point of view, but he might be untrue enough to the traditions of
countless students of the past to find Greek grammar interesting.

xviii
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</p>

<p>Furthermore, since most of us learned our Attic Greek first,
when we came to Homeric Greek and found so many different
forms, the feeling very naturally arose with many that Homer has
many more forms than Attic Greek, and that they are more difficult.
On the contrary, the Homeric forms are not only simpler and more
transparent than the Attic and as a consequence more easily
learned — many Attic forms have to be explained hy a reference
to the Homeric ones — but the Homeric forms are considerably
fewer in number. This is best seen by a reference to the declensional
endings, as exemplified in the two tables, 479, 649.</p>

<p>From these tables we see that there are, all told, 86 Homeric
forms of the noun and adjective to be learned as against 108 Attic
forms. But this is not all. Many forms in both Attic and
Homeric Greek are so rare that it would be manifestly absurd to
compel first-year students to memorize them. For our purposes,
then, we must omit the unusually rare forms from both tables.
In the first table (479) we shall omit a number of forms which
many would include, and count only those not inclosed in brackets
which are regularly included as essential by the standard beginners’
books based on the Attic dialect. We shall not count the very
rare Homeric forms, but shall be liberal enough to include a few
which are too rare to be learned in reading Homer but are important
for students intending to read Attic Greek later. We
find then that students who' begin with Homeric Greek need to
learn only 55 forms as against 80 (88 according to some) of
the Attic. This means that it is necessary to memorize about
fifty per cent more forms in order to be able to read the first
four books of the Anabasis than it would be to read the first
six books of the Iliad. Furthermore, in the pronouns, by not
compelling the student to memorize any form which does not
occur on an average of at least once every two or three thousand
verses, there would be fewer Homeric forms to be learned here
also. The same is true of the verbs. The reflexive pronoun, for
example, and the future passive and future optative of verbs are
not found in Homer; the middle voice regularly retains the uncontracted
forms of the endingS and not in a part only as in Attic

xix
<pb/></p>

<p>Greek; and in many other ways the forms are simpler and more
easily learned. In fact many books for beginners find it easier to
teach Attic Greek by a constant reference to the earlier forms,
which in many cases are the Homeric.</p>

<p>The occasional irregular forms, which are omitted from the
ones to be learned, should be grouped in some convenient way for
reference, but need not be memorized, as they are regularly given
in their alphabetical place in the vocabulary of any good school
edition and in the ordinary lexicons. Thus the student need
not be required to memorize the five forms of the present infinitive
of ειμί, or the five forms of the genitive of iyu>, e.g., but could
learn one of each and not burden his memory with forms which
are found in every vocabulary.</p>

<p>Many Atticists have maintained that the great number of
irregularities in Homeric Greek would be an added difficulty to the
beginner. It is true that they are troublesome, but not so troublesome
as the considerably greater number of irregularities in Attic
Greek. Any one who will take the trouble to count them will
find that the irregular formations in Attic Greek considerably
outnumber those in Homer. There is not space here to catalogue
the various irregularities, heteroclites, metaplastic forms, etc., of
Attic Greek, but the lists given in Kuehner-Blass, or any other of
the more elaborate Greek grammars, are enough to convince the
most skeptical.</p>

<p>If we leave aside the irregularities and look at a few regular
formations which must be memorized, the evidence is none the less
conclusive. For example, the “regular” declensions of such words
as πόλις, βασιλεύς, νανς, τέηχνς, αστν, comparatives in -ιων, and other
forms which will readily occur to any one who has studied Attic
Greek, are so complicated that they are not ordinarily mastered by
students of beginning Greek, and it would be rather remarkable
if they were. Or let us consider a single class, such as typical
words of the third declension in νς, as πηχνς, δίπηχνς, ηόνς, ίγχελνς,
Ιχθύς. If the student learned the declension of any one of these,
and attempted to decline the rest accordingly, he would go far
astray; for of these five words, all of the third declension, and all

xx
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

ending in vs in the nominative, no two are declined alike
throughout. A comparison of the declensions of lyxcXvs (eel) with
that of Ιχθνs (fish) will illustrate the point. It seems that the old
Athenians were never able to decide definitely whether an eel
was a fish or a serpent. Accordingly, we find that they declined
lyXcXvt the first half of the way like Ιχθνs, while the other
half was different. What a pity that there are not a few more
such convenient mnemonic devices to help the student keep his
bearings on his way through the maze of Greek morphology!
If a student finally learned to decline such a word as raCs, he would
not know how to begin the declension of another word formed in
the same way, such as ypavi; nor would a student who had
learned the declension of βονς in Attic Greek know the declension
of the next word like it, χονς, and he might be led
very far astray by such a simple and common word as voCs.
All of these forms, and many more which could be cited, are highly
interesting to philologists, as they illustrate so beautifully certain
abstruse principles in Greek phonology and morphology. Unfortunately
they do not usually have the same strong appeal to
the beginner who is trying very hard to learn how to read
Greek.</p>

<p>The whole system of contraction, which is regular at times, and
the variations caused by it in the general rules- of accent and
quantity, all of which are so confusing and so difficult to the
ordinary beginner, are so little used in Homer that they can very
profitably be omitted, or else touched quite lightly, and the time
saved can be invested elsewhere to much greater advantage.</p>

<p>In the field of syntax Homer is so much simpler than Xenophon
that students ordinarily find him a great deal easier. Tlius
Homer lacks the articular infinitive; long and involved passages
in indirect discourse never occur, as well as many other strange
and foreign characteristics of Attic Greek and Xenophon, all of
which give a great deal of trouble to the ordinary beginner.</p>

<p>These elements all contribute to a quicker and an easier learning
of Greek through Homer, as has been abundantly proved by experiments
also. Thus students who begin with Homer regularly read

xxi
<pb/>

more Greek in the time devoted to him than do those who begin
with Xenophon and spend this time on the Anabasis.</p>

<p>It has long been a commonly accepted myth that Homer has
such an enormous vocabulary that students would have more
than ordinary trouble with it. In fact the vocabulary of the first
six books of the Iliad is no larger than that required for reading the
Anabasis, and one can read the whole of the Homeric poems, including
the hymns, without having to learn many more words
than to read Xenophon, and without having to learn so many
words as are necessary for the reading of Plato.</p>

<p>There are, it is true, a great number of words in Homer which are
used only once (απαξ λεγάμενα).1 The Iliad has 1097 of these,
while the Odyssey has 868, making a total of 1965. However,
this is not nearly so large as the number used by Xenophon, who
has 3021 απαξ λεγάμενα,2 of which 433 are in the Anabasis, as compared
with 266 (238 if we omit the Catalogue of Ships) in the first
six books of the Iliad.</p>

<p>It is highly important too in gaining a vocabulary to learn words
which will be used in other authors read later in the course, and to
acquire so far as possible the more fundamental meanings of words
from which their later uses are derived. Ahrens, who made a
careful study of this problem, gives the palm to Homer here without
question. According to' him, the words in Homer are much
nearer their fundamental meanings, and take on different shades of
significance in the various later authors. If one wishes to obtain
a clear grasp of Greek onomatology and semasiology, he should
begin with Homer by all means and would thus be prepared to
see more readily the later turns in the meanings of words and
phrases, which in many cases vary considerably in authors of the
same period, and sometimes even in the same author. Thus there
are over 400 words in the Anabasis which either do not occur
at all in Xenophon’s other works, or else with a different signification.
Rutherford (The New Phryn., 160 if.) says: “It did not

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

escape the notice of later Greeks that Xenophon’s diction was very
different from that of pure Attic writers, and there are still extant
several remarks upon this point. ... A busy man, living almost
wholly abroad, devoted to country pursuits and the life of the
camp, attached to the Lacedaemonian system of government, and
detesting the Athenian, Xenophon must have lost much of the
refined Atticism with which he was conversant in his youth. It is
not only in the forms of words that he differs from Attic writers,
but he also uses many terms — the ονόματα γλωσσηματικά of
Galen — altogether unknown to Attic prose, and often assigns to
Attic words a meaning not actually attached to them in the
leading dialect.”</p>

<p>When it comes to the actual number of words of Xenophon and
Homer which enter into the vocabulary of other Greek writers,
the following tables will show their relation to some of the most
important authors read in college.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of Xenophon and Homer, which are compared
in these lists, are: Xenophon’s Anabasis entire, and Homer’s
Iliad, books I-VL The pages as given above are according to
the Teubner texts. The number of words in Xenophon’s Anabasis
is approximately the same as that of Homer’s Iliad, books I-VI.</p>

<p>In these lists, words which are closely enough related to others
that ordinary students who know the meaning of one may infer
the other are counted but once, as θάνατο·;, αθάνατοί; βαίνω, Ζκ-
βαίνω, καταβαίνω, αναβαίνω, etc. Proper names are also omitted.</p>

<p>From this table it will be seen that Homer is a much better
preparation for the Greek drama, Hesiod, the elegiac and iambic
poets, than is Xenophon, and it is along these lines that the course
should be developed. For Plato the difference is so exceedingly
slight that in the matter of vocabulary one is practically as good a
preparation as the other, and a few of his easier dialogues should
find a place after some of the best poetry has been read. After
that the Greek course ought to be able to take care of itself. Herodotus
might come at any point. There is a slight advantage here
on the side of Xenophon in the matter of vocabulary, but his
language is so much closer to that of Homer, as well as his general
style and imaginative genius, that he would be very easy and
stimulating to those who had read any considerable amount of
Homeric Greek. Those who wished to read Thucydides and the
orators would find Xenophon’s vocabulary somewhat better for
their purpose, and the same is true if they wished to read the
New Testament and Menander; but in all these the advantage
is relatively slight, and in most cases the difference would probably
not be noticeable. In the case of the New Testament, for example,
the difference is less than one word in two Teubner pages of Greek
text.</p>

<p>It is generally recognized that for the best results in the study
of the New Testament, students should read a considerable amount
of other Greek first. In the whole circle of Greek literature the
two authors most important for the student of the New Testament
are Homer and Plato. Herodotus informs us that Homer and
Hesiod were the chief sources of the Greek popular religion; and

xxiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

certainly one cannot obtain a clear grasp of the forces opposed to
Christianity without a good knowledge of Homer and of the hold
that Homer had upon the popular mind. If one is to read intelligently
the works of the early church fathers, he must be well
acquainted at first hand with Homer. It is Homer, Homer’s
religion, and Homer’s gods which recur constantly in their works
and which are attacked over and over again as being the bulwarks of
the heathen faith which they are striving to supplant. Homer and
the ideas he represents are infinitely more important for the student
of the New Testament and of the early church than is Xenophon;
and if one can study not more than a year or so of Greek before
taking up the New Testament, he should by all means have some
Homer followed by Plato. Experience has shown that after a
year of Homer, students can and do pass with little difficulty
into the New Testament. The passage from Homer to Attic, or
to Hellenistic, Greek is of course a great deal easier than vice versa,
and occupies very little time and effort.</p>

<p>Some have urged that since the bulk of the work in the ordinary
college course in Greek is in the Attic dialect, students who begin
with this would get a firmer grasp of it than if they began with
Homer. Some even feel that a student who did his beginning
work in Homeric forms would never be able to feel thoroughly at
home in Attic Greek. Yet few teachers would be rash enough to
suggest that because a student has had a thorough""training in
Attic Greek he is thereby disqualified from doing first-class work
in the language of the Hellenistic period, nor would many teachers
of New Testament Greek, e.g., object to a student who wished
to specialize in their subject, or even in Patristic Greek, if he came
to them with a good knowledge of Plato. Students who wish to
specialize in Pliny and Tacitus, or even in Mediaeval Latin, do
not find themselves handicapped because they did their earlier
work in such authors as Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, and
Catullus. Teachers of the Romance languages also universally
recognize that a thorough course in Latin is a prerequisite for the
highest type of scholarship in their field, and no student could
hope to do advanced linguistic work in any of these languages

xxv
<pb/>

without a thorough training in Latin. In the same way Homer
offers an unexcelled preparation not only for all later Greek literature
but for the later language as well; and instead of the present
system of confusion in the teaching of Greek grammar, particularly
with reference to the various dialects, some attempt should be
made to develop the subject in a more scientific fashion.</p>

<p>Some feel that Homer is too beautiful and too exquisite to be
used as a corpus vile for the teaching of Greek grammar. But
the very fact that he is so beautiful and so exquisite is the very
reason why he should be used at this early stage, that the students
may have an added incentive for learning their grammar, and may
not come to hate and despise the whole subject. Thus they may
see, even from the beginning, that Greek is something worth
working at, and they may have material interesting enough that
the necessary grammatical drill will not seem so much useless
drudgery.</p>

<p>A highly important consideration in placing Homer before Xenophon
in the curriculum is the fact that as matters now stand such a
large per cent of our students never reach Homer. The problem
before us with regard to these students is whether we are to give
them Xenophon or Homer. Since they represent a very large
element, not all of whom are loafers either, we owe it to ourselves
and to the cause of Greek, as well as to them, to give them that
which will be of most lasting value to them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Homer is interesting not only to older students, but
is particularly adapted to the youngest who now take Greek, as
the earliest experiments, made with boys from nine to fourteen
years of age, have amply demonstrated. He serves the double
purpose of introducing them adequately to the language and of
furnishing them with reading material as interesting as can be
found in any literature, something too of permanent value; and
he should come by all means as early as possible in the course, that
he may serve as a suitable basis for the development of those
qualities of taste and appreciation, without which the study of
all art is in vain. And after we have begun with him, we find his
treasures inexhaustible. In Herbart’s expressive phrase, “Homer

xxvi
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

elevates the student without depressing the teacher.” To quote
further from his lectures on education, he says (VI, 283) : “ The
reasons for giving the preference to Homer’s Odyssey in early instruction
are well known. Any one who reads the Odyssey carefully,
with an eye to the various main classes of interest which are
to be aroused by education, can discover the reasons. The point,
however, to be gained here is not merely to produce a direct effect,
but beyond that to get points of connection for progressive instruction.
There can be no better preparation for ancient history
than gaining interest for ancient Greece by the Homeric stories.
The ground is prepared for both the cultivation of taste and the
study of languages at the same time.

“Philologists will be obliged sooner or later to listen to reasons
of this kind, which are actually derived from the chief aim of all
instruction, and are only opposed by tradition (the conventional
study of Latin). This they must do, unless they desire that now,
with the growth of history and science, and the pressure of material
interests, Greek should be restricted in schools as Hebrew is at
present.

“ The Odyssey, it is true, possesses no magic power to animate
those who are entirely unsuccessful in languages, or who do not
work at them seriously; nevertheless it surpasses in definite educative
influence, as is proved by the experience of many years,
every other work of classic times that could be choserfi”</p>

<p>In conclusion the writer would earnestly suggest that it is high
time that Xenophon be omitted completely from at least the first
three years of Greek study. The time and labor now devoted to
both Xenophon and Homer should be spent on Homer alone, and
for the three books of the Iliad and the four books of the Anabasis
usually read should be substituted a course in Homer which would
be extensive enough to give the students a real insight into his
poetry, that they may learn to wander for themselves in the realms
of gold, that they may be allowed to become so familiar with his language
and his style that reading from him will be a pleasure and
not a lot of hard work to be waded through, that they may become
so filled with his spirit that they may catch a glimpse of what it

xxvii
<pb/>

means to be Homeric, and in later years, if they have gone out
into other fields and would like to turn back to Greek literature,
it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to bring out
their old book and enter again with delight into his world of song.
In the secondary schools we should have a course in Homer comprehensive
enough to enable the students to obtain a firm grounding
in his language and ideas, instead of the present smattering
of both Xenophon and Homer, neither of which the average student
knows well enough for it to serve as a stable and satisfactory basis
for future work. It would be a real step forward on the part of
the colleges, and should largely increase the number of those now
offering Greek for admission, if the requirements in Greek should
be made a requirement in Homer only, due attention being paid to
composition and grammar, of course. Thus the secondary schools
could intensify their efforts on one dialect and on one homogeneous
mass of literature, which would materially simplify their problems,
and ought to produce a much higher grade of work than is possible
at present. If colleges would admit students on one, two, and three
years, respectively, of Homer, with due credit for each, and reserve
all work in the Attic dialect for the college course proper,
the secondary teachers would have their burdens greatly lightened,
with a corresponding increase in effectiveness. In no other language
do the secondary schools undertake to prepare a student
in two separate dialects. To do so in Greek is a pedagogical
blunder which should be perpetuated no longer.
<pb/>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>The Iliad and the Odyssey, the two great Greek epics, and the
greatest of all epic poems, belong to the earliest Greek literature
that has been preserved.</p>

<p>Their action and stories are legendary and are grouped around
the incidents concerning the long siege of Troy by the Greeks, its
final capture and destruction, and the return of the Greeks home.
No attempt is made to give a systematic account of those events,
but certain leading features of the legends are developed.</p>

<p>The Iliad, has for its central theme and as the thread upon which
it strings its various events the Menis, the mad anger of Achilles,
and its dire consequences to the Greeks.</p>

<p>According to the story, Paris, son of King Priam of Troy (Ilios)
in Asia Minor, eloped with Helen, the most beautiful woman in the
world, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, in southern Greece. The
Greeks united under the command of King Agamemnon of Mycenae,
brother of Menelaus, and the most powerful of the Greek chieftains,
to avenge this wrong, capture Troy, and bring back Helen.
After ten years of preparation they gathered their forces, sailed
across the Aegean to the shores of the Hellespont (Dardanelles),
landed, and drew up their ships, out of the water, in long lines on
the shore. For ten years the siege continued before the Greeks
were able to capture the city.</p>

<p>The Iliad opens, in the ninth year of the siege, with the deadly
quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles. Before all the assembled
Greeks, Agamemnon disgraces and humiliates Achilles, and robs
him of his prize of honor which had been previously bestowed
upon him by the army. In rage and disgust, Achilles retires from

xxix
<pb/>

the conflict and sulks in his tent. As he had been their stoutest
warrior, his absence is keenly felt by the Greeks, who suffer many
defeats and heavy losses at the hands of the Trojans, now that
Achilles has withdrawn. It is only the death of his bosom friend,
Patroclus, in battle, which furnishes a motive sufficiently powerful
to induce him to take a further part in the war. To avenge his
death, Achilles enters the conflict once more, and lulls Hector,
who had slain Patroclus. Shortly thereafter he was himself killed
by an arrow shot by Paris with the help of Apollo. Finally, in the
tenth year of the siege, Troy was captured by the Greeks, by
means of the well-known stratagem of the Wooden Horse. The
city was plundered and burned; the men were killed and the women
taken as slaves. Helen was recovered ; and after many adventures
and losses by shipwreck and other misfortunes the Greeks returned
home.</p>

<p>The traditional date of the fall of Troy was 1184 b.c. The date
of the Homeric poems is not at all certain. Some think they are
as early as 850 b.c., while others would date them as late as the
latter part of the seventh century B.C. Many scholars have
thought that the poems represent a gradual growth of a long period
of time, that they were composed by a number of different bards,
and'have been worked over, edited and re-edited, till they gradually
acquired their present form. Many of these scholars would deny
that any one by the name of Homer ever lived. Others think that
Homer was one of the editors, perhaps the most important of the
editors, of the poems, that he may have composed a considerable
amount of material in them, but that his chief function consisted
in combining and working over the various lays handed down by
his predecessors. Still others are of the opinion that the whole
of the poems, or practically all of them, as we have them, were
composed outright by a single poet, who was a real historical
character, and whose name was Homer. Most are agreed that
there must have been some great, master mind, whose influence is
felt throughout the poems, but who made free use of the work
of other poets who had preceded him and who had sung of various
events connected with the same theme. As Kipling would say:</p>

<p>W’en Omer smote ’is bloomin’ lyre,
’E’d ’eard men sing by land and sea,
And wot ’e thought ’e might require,
Έ went and took, the same as me.</p>

<p>The old Greeks were practically unanimous in believing that
the poems were composed by a bard, named Homer, and
that he traveled about, in various parts of Greece, a poor,
old, blind beggar, eking out an existence by singing his poems.
After his death, we are told that: “ Seven cities claimed the</p>

<p>Homer dead, through which
the living Homer begged his
bread.” The chief contestants
for the honor of his birthplace
were Smyrna and Chios,
and the evidence of the poems
would seem to point to that
region.</p>

<p>The poems represent a very
unsettled condition of society in
the Greek world, corresponding
in many ways to the Middle
Ages in Europe. Preceding this
period, there had been a brilliant
civilization in the Greek world
in the Aegean basin. This civilization

the existence of the seat of a great island empire. Its commerce
and its influence touched all the shores of the Mediterranean,
and it seems to have been in vital touch with the early Babylonian
and Egyptian cultures. Other centers were Mycenae,

<p>Argos, Athens, Pylus, and Sparta, in Europe, and Troy in Asia
Minor.</p>

<p>It was finally destroyed by invasions of barbarians from the
North, much as the Roman Empire finally succumbed to the
Germanic invasions. These invaders were the early Greeks, and
this period is usually called the Homeric Age, because so many of
its features are reflected in the Homeric poems, the Iliad and the
Odyssey.</p>

<p>The times were rude, and social life was primitive. War and
piracy were ordinary pursuits. The people grouped themselves
around powerful chieftains for protection, but marauding bands
were common, which killed, burned, and plundered. Personal
valor and prowess in battle were of supreme importance, not only
for one’s own safety, but for the safety and freedom of his friends
and family as well. Accordingly, the greatest virtue, and the
one held in highest esteem, was bravery in war.</p>

<p>For our picture of the culture of this period we are dependent
upon the Homeric poems. In them we see how expeditions were
made by the Greeks against their enemies, whom they considered
at all times as legitimate objects of plunder. Usually such expeditions
were under one of the many petty Homeric “kings.” Of
these there were a great number; and there was no unity and no
central authority in Homeric Greece any more than there were
in the later historical period.</p>

<p>According to the tradition, the expedition against Troy was
undertaken by the whole of Greece, united under the leadership
of Agamemnon. Some think that this tradition rests upon an
ultimate basis of fact; but this may be merely an idealistic touch,
expressing an earnest hope of the poet, that the various Greek
tribes may reconcile their differences and stop warring on each
other long enough to make war upon the common foe, the barbarians,
as represented by the non-Greek inhabitants of Asia
Minor. In the Homeric poems we find that although Agamemnon
was commander in chief of the allied Greek military expedition,
the various contingents were led by their own commanders, most
of whom were their kings, apparently quite independent of Aga-

memnon when at home, and semi-independent of him during the
jxpedition. The most important of these secondary leaders were :
[Nestor of Pylus, the oldest man in the world; Agamemnon’s
brother, Menelaus, the wronged husband of Helen; the young,
daring, generous, and impetuous Achilles of Phthia; the mighty
Diomedes of Argos, who fought with the very gods themselves;
the wily Odysseus (Ulysses) of Ithaca, who wandered for ten years
after the fall of Troy before he arrived safe at home and saw once
more his wife, the faithful Penelope; the huge and brutal Telamonian
Ajax of Salamis; the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus of Locris;</p>

/</p>

<p>Teucer, the Archer, brother of Telamonian Ajax; and Idomeneus
of Crete, the far-famed isle of a hundred cities.</p>

<p>On the Trojan side the most important characters are: Hector,
eldest son of Priam and commander-in-chief of the Trojan forces;
the aged Priam, King of Troy; Hecuba, his wife; Andromache,
wife of Hector; Paris, brother of Hector and the one who had
brought on the war by stealing Helen; Glaucus and Sarpedon,
princes of Lycia, whose beautiful and unselfish friendship is only
matched by that of Achilles and Patroclus on the Greek side.</p>

<p>The divinities take an active part in the conflict, some siding
with the Greeks, the others with the Trojans. Zeus, who stands

xxxiii
<pb/>

at the head of the gods, as father and king of gods and men, seems
inclined to be neutral. Hera his wife, queen of the gods, cherishes
an implacable hatred against the Trojans, as does Athena, his
daughter, goddess of war, wisdom, and the arts. Poseidon, brother
of Zeus, the mighty god of the sea, is also on the side of the Greeks,
and loses no opportunity to help them. On the Trojan side were
Apollo, god of light, who wards off darkness and evil, patron of
music, poetry and healing; Artemis, his sister, a divinity of the
moonlight, goddess of the woods and wild animals, and patroness
of the chase; Leto, their mother; Aphrodite, born of the white
sea-foam, goddess of love and beauty, who had assisted Paris in
obtaining Helen; Hephaestus, the lame god of fire, patron of all
useful mechanical arts and the working of metals; and the rivergod
Scamander, a stream near Troy.</p>

<p>The gods are distinctly human in their characteristics and
attributes, with human appetites and passions. They differ from
men primarily in being more powerful and in being immortal.
They enjoy a good dinner, where they feast on nectar and ambrosia;
they love and hate, are envious and jealous, but on the whole live
a .happier and serener life than mortals.</p>

<p>In translating Homer, it would be well to hold in mind the four
essential characteristics of his poetry as enumerated by Matthew
Arnold: “ Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his
words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble
in his manner.”</p>

<p>For a good characterization of the Homeric poems, from the
point of view of literary art, one should by all means read Andrew
Lang’s Essay, “ Homer and the Study of Greek,” from which the
following is taken. “Homer is a poet for all ages, all races, and
all moods. To the Greeks the epics were not only the best of
romances, the richest of poetry; not only their oldest documents
about their own history — they were also their Bible, their treasury
of religious traditions and moral teaching. With the Bible and
Shakespeare, the Homeric poems are the best training for life.
There is no good quality that they lack : manliness, courage, reverence
for old age and the hospitable hearth; justice, piety, pity, a

xxxiv
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

brave attitude toward life and death, are all conspicuous in Homer.
He has to write of battles; and he delights in the joy of battle,
and in all the movements of war. Yet he delights not less, but
more, in peace: in prosperous cities, hearths secure, in the tender
beauty of children, in the love of wedded wives, in the frank nobility
of maidens, in the beauty of earth and sky and sea and seaward
murmuring river, in sun and snow, frost and mist and rain, in the
whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and pine tree.

“ living in an age when every man was a warrior, where every
city might know the worst of sack and fire, where the noblest ladies</p>

<p>Storeroom in the Palace at Cnossus

might be led away for slaves, to light the fire and make the bed of
a foreign master, Homer inevitably regards life as a battle. To
each man on earth comes ‘ the wicked day of destiny,’ as Malory
unconsciously translates it, and each man must face it hardily as
he may.

“ Homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and honor.
His heart is with the brave of either side — with Glaucus and Sarpedon
of Lycia no less than with Achilles and Patroclus. ‘Ah
friend,’ cries Sarpedon, ‘if once escaped from this battle we were
for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I myself fight

xxxv
<pb/>

now in the foremost ranks, nor would I urge thee into the wars that
give renown; but now — for assuredly ten thousand fates of
death on every side beset us, and these may no man shun, nor avoid
— forward let us go, whether we are to give glory or to win it.’
And forth they go, to give and take renown and death, all the
shields and helmets of Lyeia shining behind them, through the
dust of battle, the singing of arrows, the hurtling of spears, the
rain of stones from the Locrian slings. And shields are smitten,
and chariot-horses run wild, with no man to drive them, and Sarpedon
drags down a portion of the Achaean battlement, and Aias
leaps into the trench with his deadly spear, and the whole battle
shifts and shines beneath the sun. Yet he who sings of the war,
and sees it with his sightless eyes, sees also the Trojan women
working at the loom, cheating their anxious hearts with broidery
work of gold and scarlet, or raising the song to Athena, or heating
the bath for Hector, who never again may pass within the gates of
Troy. He sees the poor weaving woman, weighing the wool, that
she may not cheat her employers, and yet may win bread for her
children. He sees the children, the golden head of Astyanax, his
shrinking from the splendor of the hero’s helm. He sees the child
Odysseus, going with his father through the orchard, and choosing
out some apple trees*‘for his very own.’ It is in the mouth of the
ruthless Achilles, the fatal, the fated, the swift-footed hero of
the hands of death, that Homer places the tenderest of his similes.
‘Wherefore weepest thou, Patroclus, like a fond little maid that
runs by her mother’s side, praying her mother to take her up,
snatching at her gown, and hindering her as she walks, and tearfully
looking at her till her mother takes her up ? — Like her,
Patroclus, dost thou fondly weep.’ . . . Such are the moods of
Homer, so full of love of life and all things living, so rich in all
human sympathies, so readily moved when the great hound Argus
welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but the
hound knew him, and died in that welcome. With all this love
of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of
armor, of implement of art; on the divers-colored gold work of the
shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the forging of

xxxvi
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

iron, on the rose-tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on cooking and
eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and their ways, on
fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths where fair maidens
lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered isles with good harbors
and rich land, on plowing, mowing, and sowing, on the furniture of
houses, on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is
laid, — with all this delight in the real, Homer is the most romantic
of poets. He walks with the surest foot in the
darkling realm of dread Persephone, beneath
the poplars of the last beach of Ocean. He has
heard the siren’s music, and the song of Circe,
chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the
golden shuttle through the loom of gold. He
enters the cave of the man-eater; he knows
the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; in the
summer of the North he has looked, from the
fiord of the Laestrygons, on the midnight sun.</p>

<p>He has dwelt on the floating isle of Aeolus,
with its wall of bronze unbroken, and has sailed
on those Phaeacian barks that need no help
of helm or oar, that fear no stress either of
wind or tide, that come and go and return,
obedient to a thought and silent as a dream.</p>

<p>He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters
of wells and woods, and of sacred streams. He
is the second-sighted man, and beholds the
shroud that wraps the living who are doomed, and the mystic
dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed. He has walked in
the garden closes of Phaeacia and looked on the face of gods who
fare thither and watch the weaving of the dance. He has eaten
the honey-sweet fruit of the Lotus, and from the hand of Helen
he brings us that Egyptian Nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of
the mind. His real world is as real as that of Eenry V., his enchanted
isles are charmed with the magic of the Tempest. His
young wooers are as insolent as Claudio, as flushed with youth;
his beggar-men are brethren of Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is

xxxvii
<pb/>

sister to Rosalind, with a different charm of stately purity in love.
His enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is
very beauty; she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and
her repentance is without remorse. His Achilles is youth itself,
glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and loving, and
conscious of its doom. Homer, in truth, is to be matched only
by Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not the occasional
willfulness, freakishness, and modish obscurity. He is a poet
all of gold, universal as humanity, simple as childhood, musical
now as the flow of his own rivers, now as the heavy plunging wave
of his own ocean. . . .

“Such then, as far as weak words can speak of him, is the first
and greatest of poets.”</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Vocabulary. — One of the things most important in learning any
language so as to be able to read it with profit and pleasure is to
acquire a fair-sized vocabulary. In doing this, one should learn
thoroughly the words that are used most. For this purpose there
is a highly practical little book, Homeric Vocabularies, Owen
and Goodspeed, published by the University of Chicago Press.
The most common Homeric words are arranged in it in groups,
according to frequency of occurrence. A copy of this book should
be in the hands of every student who wishes to lighten his work in
learning to read and enjoy Homer.</p>

<p>Forms of the Greek Verb. — In learning the Greek verb, the most
difficult part of Greek grammar, it is highly important to know
which forms are most essential. The following material, with the
two tables, compiled by Professor Robbins, will indicate where the
stress of work should come. These tables will be found valuable,
not only for Homeric Greek, but for other Greek as well. By
emphasizing strongly the forms which are most common, it will
be found that the work will be materially lightened, and the
Greek verb will not be found at all formidable.

“ Table I tabulates the result of counting the verb forms found
on ten pages each of Homer, Euripides, Herodotus, Demosthenes,

xxxviii
<pb/>

and Plato, and on twenty of Xenophon (ten each from the Anabasis
and the Memorabilia). In most cases the pages of the Oxford
Classical Texts or the Bibliotheca Teubneriana have been made
the unit, and for the present purpose the variation in the amount of
Greek on the page need cause no concern. It may be remarked,
also, that first and second perfects have been counted together
because they are best taught together, and that the present
participle of <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἰμι</foreign> has been included among the thematic present
participles.<note n="xxxxix.1">“ Another liberty which I have taken is to disregard perfects of the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> form, reckoning all perfects together. Aorists like <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβην</foreign> are counted as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> forms.”</note>

“The revelations of Table I make clear a few points that have a
definite bearing on the teaching of Greek. In the first place, it
shows that a large majority of the verbs one meets in reading
Greek are confined to a small group of forms. Table II will make
this clearer; it will then appear that nine or ten forms make up
over a half, and twenty-four forms three-quarters, of the verbs
in average Greek. Is it not right that we should first concern
ourselves with teaching these forms ? Of course, one must not
guide himself entirely by these, or any similar, statistics; often it
is advantageous to teach a whole group together, even though this
involves the introduction of certain rather rare forms together with
others that are commoner. On the other hand, here we have a
definite, practical ground for demanding that certain forms be
introduced very early.

“ Among these the present active participle deserves special
mention. The statistics show the high frequency of its occurrence,
and indeed few sentences, save the most elementary, can be mastered
without a knowledge of it. Furthermore, its inflection can
easily be made an introduction to both the first and third declensions,
and one should not readily pass by an opportunity to kill
three birds with one stone.

“ The apparently high frequency of the present and imperfect
indicative and the present infinitive of -μι verbs is due not so
much to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἵστημι</foreign>,  <foreign xml:lang="greek">τίθημι</foreign>,  <foreign xml:lang="greek">δίδώμι</foreign>, and  <foreign xml:lang="greek">δείκνυμι</foreign> as to the constant

An Athenian School
Royal Museum, Berlin

A painting by Duris on a drinking-cup, or cylix. The picture is divided by the two handles.
In the upper half, beginning at the left: a youth playing the double flute as a lesson to the boy
before him; a teacher holding a tablet and stylus and correcting a composition ; a slave (paedagogus),
who accompanied the children to and from school. In the lower half: a master teaching
his pupil to play the tyre; a teacher holding a half-opened roll, listening to a recitation by
the student before him; a bearded paedagogus. The inner picture, badly damaged, represents
a youth in a bath.

Note. — Observe that the long doubtful vowels (519) are not
marked in the Homeric passages (520), as their length must be learned
from the metre.

63. 
1. <foreign xml:lang="greek">μἦνιν</foreign> is emphatic, by position, as the central theme of the Iliad. It is the mad wrath of Achilles, and its terrible consequences to the Greeks, which the poet uses as a thread for his plot. —
 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀείδε [άειδω]</foreign> : pres. act. imperat., 2d sing., sing, i.e. inspire me with thy gift of song, <ref>1069</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεά</foreign> (the muse of song) is vocative. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδεω</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδᾱο</foreign> <ref>573</ref> (probably <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδᾱ’ Ἀχιλῆος</foreign> stood here originally).

2. <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐλομένην</foreign> is emphatic as being at the bead of the verse, and at the
end of its clause, and out of the natural order. It is in a kind of apposition
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν</foreign>, as though it were an afterthought, and is expanded and

<pb n="22"/>

amplified by the following clause. — 

ἥ [ὅs, ἥ, ὅ <ref>773</ref>] refers to <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν- —
μῡρί’ Ἀχαιοῖς</foreign> : for the hiatus see <ref>576</ref> ; <ref>1178.3</ref>.

3. Merely a picturesque way of saying “killed.” — <foreign xml:lang="greek">προΐαψεν:</foreign> <ref>830-831</ref>, <ref>837</ref>.—

Ἄιδι, = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἌϜιδι.</foreign> To the ancient Greeks the realm of Hades
was not primarily a place of punishment, of tortures, and of horrors, as
the Christian Hell, but was a faint and cheerless copy of the upper world,
and was the abode of all departed spirits of the dead. Consequently no
one, no matter how good and pious, was anxious to die.

4. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡρώων</foreign> is emphatic, as coming at the beginning of the verse, and
out of its natural order. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">δὲ ἑλώρια</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">δε Ϝελώρια</foreign> (<ref>580</ref>). — <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτούς</foreign> : themselves, i.e. their bodies, as contrasted with their shadows, or souls.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">τεῦχε</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔτευχε</foreign> : <ref>837</ref>. In order for the soul of the deceased to obtain rest,
it was necessary that the body be buried, or cremated, with the proper
funeral rites. If the enemy gained possession of his foe’s body, as a
mark of the worst he could do, he might give it over to the dogs and
birds to devour. This heightened the pathos of the poet’s theme. The
scene on the opposite page shows how bitterly the old Greeks and Trojans
fought for the bodies of the slain. Achilles, who has been shot through
the heel by Paris, lies dead in the midst of the fray. The Trojans have
pounced upon his body, eager to drag it within their own lines. Glaucus,
one of their number, while attempting to tie a thong to the foot of
Achilles, falls mortally wounded by Ajax, who is stoutly defending the
corpse. Other Trojans, including Paris, Aeneas, Laodocus, and Echippus,
have joined in the battle.

5. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐτελεῖετο [τελείω]</foreign> : imperf. pass, indic., 3d sing., was being accomplished.

These verses, together with the two following, form the prooemium,
or introduction to the Iliad. The subject is announced in the very first
word (μῆνις). It is the wrath of Achilles and its disastrous consequences
to the Greeks, but all in accordance with the will of Zeus,
which form the principal theme of the poem.

64. Translate :

1. The valiant Achaeans are singing the accursed wrath of Achilles. 

2. The wrath of Achilles caused many woes to the Achaeans and sent many valiant souls of heroes to the god Hades. 

3. We shall make the army of the Achaeans a booty for the dogs and a banquet for the birds. 

4. We are accomplishing the will of the goddess.

<p>Iliad, 1-5

65. 1) Read carefully the sections on quantity and prosody, <ref>519-526</ref> and <ref>1159-1192</ref>.</p>

<p>2) Copy and mark the scansion of the first five verses of the Iliad.

66. Remember that the only vowels the quantity of which
is not known are <foreign xml:lang="greek">α</foreign>, ι, <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign> and that their length is indicated in
the vocabulary. As soon as possible the student should
master the rules for the length of vowels of the inflectional
endings, so as to be free from the vocabulary in this particular.

67. In marking the scansion of these verses, use the sign
(ˉ) to indicate a long syllable, and the sign (˘) for a short
syllable, separating the feet from each other by the perpendicular
line ( | )·

68. The written word-accent must be disregarded in reading
the verse.

69. Iliad 1-5


70. The first syllable of <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν</foreign> must be long, having a long
vowel, <ref>522</ref>. The accent shows that the second syllable must
be short, <ref>545</ref>, <ref>1160</ref>. Then, having one long and one short,
the next syllable (ἄ-) must be short, as when there is one
long followed by a short, there must be another short to
complete the foot, <ref>1169</ref>.

The next syllable (-ει-) is long, being a diphthong, <ref>521-522</ref>.

<pb n="24"/>

The next syllable (-δε) is short, having a short vowel followed
by a single consonant.

The next syllable (<foreign xml:lang="greek">θε-</foreign>) is short also, having a short vowel
followed by another vowel.

As this completes this foot, the final syllable (-ά) of <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεά</foreign> .
must be long, as it is the first, syllable of the next foot, <ref>1171</ref>.

The next syllable (<foreign xml:lang="greek">Πη-</foreign>) is long, having a long vowel, <ref>522</ref>.

The next syllable (-λη-) is long, having a long vowel, <ref>522</ref>.

The next vowel (-ι-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-ά-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next vowel (-ε-) is short, but as the first syllable of a
foot must be long, <ref>1171</ref>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">-δεω</foreign> is pronounced as one long
syllable, by synizesis, <ref>586</ref>.

The next vowel (Ἀ-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-χι-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-λῆ-) is long, having a long vowel.

The final syllable (-ος) is short, having a short vowel, but
must be marked long here, as the final syllable is always long,
owing to the pause in the verse, <ref>1184</ref>.

Therefore the metrical scheme of this verse is:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |


Now mark the next verse : <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐλομένην</foreign>, ἣ <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῡρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε’
ἔθηκεν,</foreign>

The first syllable (<foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ-</foreign>) is long, being a diphthong.

The second syllable (-λο-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-μέ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-νην) is long, having a long vowel.

The next (ἣ) is long, having a long vowel.

As this completes the second foot, the next syllable (<foreign xml:lang="greek">μυ-</foreign>)
must be long, as it is the first syllable of the next foot.

The next syllable (-ρί’) is short, as is indicated by the accent,
since only short vowels are elided, <ref>575</ref>, <ref>1162</ref>.

<pb n="25"/>

Then the next syllable (Ἀ-) must be short, to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-χαι-) is long, having a diphthong.

The next syllable (-οῖς) is long, having a diphthong.

The next-syllable (ἄλ-) is long,followed by two consonants.

The next syllable (-γε’) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (ἔ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (-θη-) is long, having a long vowel.

The next syllable (-κεν) is short, but is long here, owing
to its place in the verse, <ref>1184</ref>.

Therefore this verse should be scanned as follows:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |

71. Using these principles, and the rules given, <ref>1159-1192</ref>,
mark the scansion of the first five verses, and do not attempt
any further work in Homer till these have been thoroughly
memorized and can be repeated rhythmically with ease.

72. A good plan to follow at first is to mark only the syllables
of which the quantity is certain, without having to
consult the vocabulary. When this is done, the quantity of
the remaining syllables can usually be determined from their
position in the verse.

73. Before attempting to memorize a verse, it should always
be translated several times, till the student is quite
familiar with the exact meaning of every word and understands
accurately every construction in it.

74. First the teacher may repeat these verses a few times
for the students, then with them, till they have the movement
mastered, but after that the students should be able to
recite them alone.

75. Let each student recite these separately, then let them
be repeated by small groups, and finally in concert by the
entire class.

76. In repeating these verses orally, the words must of
course be kept distinct and no break must be made between

The son of Atreus was so well known to Homer’s hearers, it was not

the cause of the quarrel, since he brought a plague upon the
Greeks, which gave occasion for the strife between Achilles and Agar
memnon.

10. <foreign xml:lang="greek">νoῦσ</foreign>ov is emphatic by position, as is <foreign xml:lang="greek">κακήν</foreign>, which is further explained
and expanded by the following clause. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὀλέκοντο</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὠλέκοντο,
837 [ὀλέκω]</foreign>, imperf. pass, indic., 3d plur., were being destroyed, kept perishing.
— <foreign xml:lang="greek">λαοί:</foreign> the soldiers in the Greek army.

On the first seven verses, read 63 (end), and compare Hermann Grimm :
“ These first verses are like the tones of a funeral march rising to a sky
shrouded with gloomy clouds. A series of verses which like heralds
announce the whole poem. A gloomy cloud gathers over the Greeks.
The field is covered with the corpses of fallen heroes. Dogs and vultures
tear the bodies of the slain. The most powerful of men and the mightiest
mortal descendant of Zeus quarrel. Zeus has determined the destruction
of the people. All this in a single sentence which closes with
<foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀχιλλεύς.”</foreign>

With fine poetic insight Homer begins his story in the very middle
with a thrilling situation, and allows the background with what has gone
before to unfold itself gradually, as it is needed, in the course of his
narrative.

In order to create a situation which would inevitably bring on a quarrel
so far-reaching in its consequences, it is not enough for merely human
factors and natural causes to operate, but some divinity must motivate
the action. This gives the poet a wider range for his creative imagination,
and makes anything possible.

90. 11. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὸν</foreign> = (illum): that well-known, since the circle of legends is

familiar to the hearers of the bard. <foreign xml:lang="greek">—ἠτίμασev [ἀτιμάζω]</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀρητῆρα:</foreign> <ref>1182</ref>.
Observe that this verse ends in two spondees, making it a “spondaic”
verse. This, together with the position of the final word, throws special
emphasis upon it, making it practically equivalent to “ although he was
a priest,” which would of course make him an object of more than ordinary
reverence.

12. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀτρεΐδης</foreign>  is made distinctly emphatic by position. It is he who
must bear the burden of responsibility in slighting the priest. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐπὶ νῆας</foreign>, i.e. to the Greek camp on the shore, where they had drawn up their
ships, out of the water.

13. <foreign xml:lang="greek">λῡσόμενος [λύω]:</foreign> fut. mid. particip., nom. sing. masc. (modifying
ὁ, which refers to the priest) peing about (desiring) to ransom, to ransom,
1109, 5. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">φέρων [φέρω]</foreign> : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (also modifies
ὀ), bearing, bringing.<foreign xml:lang="greek">—

ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα</foreign> is an example of epic exaggeration, not rare in all such compositions.

14. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔχων [ἔχω]</foreign> : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (modifies ὁ), having,
holding. The ransoms were probably of gold and silver bullion and other
valuable articles of commerce.

The priest depends upon two motives to influence the Greeks:</p>

<p>1) Cupidity, and so he brings the presents, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄποινα.</foreign></p>

<p>2) Reverence, which accounts for his wearing the fillets (ribbons of
white wool) and bearing the. sceptre as insignia of his office.

— <foreign xml:lang="greek">χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου:</foreign> originally <foreign xml:lang="greek">χερσὶ Ϝεκηβόλου.</foreign> — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος</foreign> : <ref>571</ref>, <ref>1173</ref>. Apollo has the epithet “free-shooter,” “sharp-shooter” applied
to him here, introducing him in his capacity as archer god, so
important for the further action, where he slays the Greeks with his
arrows. In his capacity as god of war, Jehovah was also an archer god
at times. “God is a righteous judge. He hath bent his bow and made
it ready.” Compare the story of the rainbow: “I shall set my bow (i.e.
my symbol as warrior god) in the cloud.”

15. <foreign xml:lang="greek">χρῡσ-έῳ</foreign> : synizesis, <ref>586</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">χρῡσέω ἀνά</foreign> : <ref>1173</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">καὶ ἐλίσσετο</foreign> : <ref>1173</ref>.
The latter part of this verse would imply that the scene takes place at a
meeting of the assembly of the Greeks.

The sceptre was a symbol of authority. Of course it was of gold if it
is to appear decently in epic. The whole atmosphere of a poem of this
kind is supramundane. Its leading characters are divine or semi-divine,
and their equipment must all be of more precious material than that

<pb n="32"/>

which suffices for ordinary mortals. Thus Apollo has a golden sword.
Several of the warriors before Troy have golden armor, and the gods
sit on golden thrones which rest upon the golden pavements of their
palaces in Olympus. In the same way the new Jerusalem has streets
of gold and gates of pearl. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐλίσσετο [λίσσομαι]</foreign> : imperf. act. ind. 3d sing, deponent verb. Observe the force of the imperfect, the old priest
kept entreating Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus, but Agamemnon,
in spite of these repeated opportunities to avail himself of the mercy of
the god, chose deliberately to slight his holy ambassador.

16. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀτρεΐδᾱ</foreign> = Menelaus and Agamemnon.

The priest is a native of Chrysa, a small town near Troy, which has
been plundered by the invading Greeks. His daughter has been taken
prisoner of war, and he now comes to the Greek camp, where the ships
have been drawn up on the shore, to ransom her.

for whom I make my entreaties.” Observe how the addition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">φίλην</foreign>

the rhyme of <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέχεσθαι.</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱκέσθαι</foreign> in vs. 19. The old priest would thus
emphasize that their return home, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱκέσθαι</foreign>, may depend upon their acceptance,

to the gifts he had brought.

18 ff. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὑμῖν θεοὶ δοϊεν</foreign>, etc.: “ may you get your wish, I mine.” Evidently
he does not object to having the Greeks collect part of their
payment from Priam and his people, who were of considerably less concern
to the priest than his own darling daughter. Homer’s characters
are often thus refreshingly individualistic. If the Greeks would grant his
request, he was willing to have his prayers enlisted on their side. He
was not the first, nor yet the last, to labor under the impression that the
outcome of a great war might be influenced by a personal appeal to his
god.

Instead of having his speech reported at second hand, the priest is
dramatically brought forward in propria persona, and speaks for himself.
The poet thus secures a more striking effect than indirect discourse
could produce.

for to insult the priest would be to insult the god. The close of

with the name of the god. Perhaps his use of the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑκηβόλον</foreign> is

To get the full effect of this situation, it must be, remembered that
the girl had been captured by the marauding Greeks, on a pillaging
expedition near Troy, and in the distribution of the booty she had
fallen to the lot of Agamemnon, whose personal property she now is.
So the old priest has little difficulty in winning over “ all the other
Achaeans,” who vociferously assent to his proposition ; but Agamemnon,
the only one who has anything to lose by the transaction, does not
prove to be so easy. Apparently he was not yet ready to return a choice
prize in exchange for a few pieces of gold and silver, or some old pots aud
pans and the paltry prayers of a pious priest. The piety of the other
Greeks and their reverence for the priest are placed in marked contrast
to the action of Agamemnon, who alone is wicked, and obstinately so.
His course is further robbed of any possible redeeming feature by the

<pb n="39"/>


fact that he is not only an ungodly sinner, but is actually rude and ill-mannered
to the priest. In requital for all this, as we shall learn in the
sequel, the people are the chief sufferers, who perish in heaps, while
Agamemnon escapes the plague. This is really an artistic blemish and
offends one’s sense of poetic justice. But it is necessary for the later
development of the plot that the king be preserved alive, and besides
throughout all history “ when the king sins the people suffer.” For an
illuminating parallel, read 2 Sam. 24 inter alia.

Agamemnon is too angry to consider any of the points urged by the
priest, and does not even thank him for his prayer for the success of the
expedition and a safe journey homeward (vss. 18-19), but takes that
all for granted (see vs. 30, next lesson). He respects neither god nor
priest, and prefers the girl to the ransom. In addressing the priest curtly
as <foreign xml:lang="greek">γέρον</foreign>, old man, he disregards his appeal as a representative of the god.

endure all this in a far-away land in the midst of strangers, who might
not always be sympathetic. The illustration on the preceding page
shows the entrance to the fortified enclosure containing' Agamemnon’s
palace, where he intended the daughter of the priest to serve him.
It is characteristic of the poet’s art that Agamemnon is represented
as leaving to the imagination just what dire form his brutality may
take, although his threat perhaps contains an intimation that if the old

priest does not depart instanter, he may pay for his temerity with his
life. Having no good arguments or adequate reasons to offer, Agamemnon
resorts to vile abuse to close the discussion and get rid of his
unwelcome visitor. Homer represents the brutality of Agamemnon in
as glaring a light as possible, to prepare the way for the righteous
indignation of the god and the fearful consequences which the Greek
hosts are to suffer for the king’s rash impiety.

contrast. This word, descriptive of the roaring, tossing sea, is
perhaps chosen to symbolize the endless tumult in the soul of the priest,
as distinguished from his outward calm, <foreign xml:lang="greek">πολυφλοίσβοιο</foreign> is an onomatopoetic
word, i.e. the sound of the word suggests and imitates the meaning,
so that by using this expression the poet makes his auditors hear
the sea roar. Cf.:

Poluphloisboisterous Homer of old
Threw all his augments into the sea,
Although he had often been courteously told
That perfect imperfects begin with an <emph>e</emph>.
But the Poet replied with a dignified air,

epithet instead of the name indicates how intimate the priest was with
the god whom he served. “ Come, O Lord, with thy silver bow ! ” By
calling upon him in his capacity as archer god, the priest already has in
mind the kind of answer he desires to his prayer. He would have the
god slay the Greeks with his arrows. Naturally the bow of Apollo must
be of precious metal, as befits the dignity of a god. Read again the
note on vs. 15, § 90. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀμφιβέβηκας</foreign> : the perfect is to be translated as a present, dost protect. It is the figure of a warrior bestriding a fallen

protection.

his title of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀργυρότοξος</foreign>, thereby intimating that he should bring along
his bow, so here he evidently has a purpose in mind by calling upon him
by his title of Smintheus, mouse god. For the old Greeks, probably
without knowing the scientific basis, recognized the connection of mice
with plagues. (Compare the spread of the bubonic plague by means of
rats.) Thus Apollo with his mice could bring a deadly plague upon
whomsoever he chose. The Philistines also, who are to be connected
with the early Greek and Trojan civilizations through Crete, their
former home, associated mice with plagues. “ And the Philistines took
the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. . . . But
the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed
them, and smote them with tumours, even Ashdod and the coasts

<pb n="48"/>

thereof. ... So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go
again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was
a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there. And the men that died not were smitten with the tumours:
and the cry of the city went up to heaven. And the Philistines called
for the priests and diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of
Jehovah ? Tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. And they
said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty;
but in any wise return him a trespass offering. . . . Then said they,
What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?
They answered, Five golden tumours and five golden mice, according to
the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you
all, and on your lords. Wherefore you shall make images of your
tumours and of the mice that mar the land.”

Another example of this sort is to be found in the account of the
destruction of the hosts of Sennacherib, which was doubtless due to a
plague of some sort. According to the Biblical narrative, “It came to
pass that night that the angel of Jehovah went out, and smote in the
camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and
when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead
corpses.” Herodotus, the early Greek historian, who traveled in Egypt
some two hundred and fifty years later, gives an account of this same
event, but associates the destruction with mice. However, in this two
hundred and fifty years the mice have risen from ordinary pest carriers
till in the narrative of Herodotus they assume an active and intelligent
part in cooperation with the Egyptian armies against the common foe.
By a night attack they fall upon their unwary enemies, and while the
army slept they gnawed their bow strings and shield straps, so that in
the morning, finding their armor useless, the hosts flee in terror, and
countless numbers of them perish in the rout that follows.

The burden of the priest’s prayer (vss. 37-42) is: “I have placed you
under great obligations; so you ought to do this little favor for me.”

In a sacrifice of this kind the priest burned choice bits of the animal

<pb n="49"/>

to the god as a banquet to him. The god obtained this as it came up
to him in the smoke that rose to heaven (cf. Gen. viii, 20-21, etc.). — <foreign xml:lang="greek">μηριά</foreign> (vs. 40) were the thigh-pieces, the bones with the marrow and some
meat. The marrow of the bones was looked upon as a special delicacy.
Observe how specific the priest is in enumerating the favors he has
conferred upon his god. “ I have built for you a shrine, for your pleasure,
and I have served to you the best thigh-pieces I could get, together
with the bones and marrow, and I swear that they had plenty of fat on
them too.”

In vss. 39-42 observe the rhyming effect produced by the repetition
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">οι</foreign> sound in these verses, which brings these words (τοι, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τοι</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">μοι,
Δαναοί</foreign><note n="grc">another place where we can use very precise annotations to specify the particular instance of  a string/token</note>) into special prominence: “If I have done thy wish for thee, then
thou shouldst do my wish for me.” The priest has done so many favors
for the god that now the god ought to do something for the priest, and
avenge his wrongs by slaying the Danaans. If we were in the realm of
reason instead of poetry, with its artistic requirements and its necessities
for the furtherance of the plot, we might ask why the old man does not
request the god to punish Agamemnon directly, which would have been
a much easier task, and might have been expected to produce the desired
results with more certainty.

44. <foreign xml:lang="greek">βή</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβη [βαίνω]</foreign>, set out. The gods live on Olympus, a high
mountain in northern Thessaly, just as the favorite home of Jehovah for a
long time was on Mt. Sinai, although he might frequent any high mountain,
as Carmel, Lebanon, or Tabor. In a very real sense heaven lay
about the human race in its infancy, in that it was supposed to be quite
near, so near in fact that if one would shout loud enough his god(s) could
hear him. Thus when one prayed, he commonly cried out with a loud
voice. “ Then stood upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried
with a loud voice to Jehovah their god.” It was thought quite possible
to erect a structure high enough that one might step out of it right into
heaven. “ And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick and
burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime for
mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven.”

Any mountain whose summit was high enough, such as Sinai or
Olympus, might thus furnish a convenient place for the fixed abode of
the gods, where they might build their homes and have some of the
comforts of family life. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κῆρ:</foreign> <ref>1014</ref>. It was not thought improper for
gods to show anger (χωόμενος). “ And while the flesh was yet between
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against
the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.” <foreign xml:lang="greek">—

among the children of men, as a system of telepathy had not yet been
elaborated. “ And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower,
which the children of men builded. ... So Jehovah scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to
build the city.” Apollo is thought of as resting at his ease in his palace

although it should be short. The reason is unknown.

46. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔκλαγξαν:</foreign> like <foreign xml:lang="greek">πολυφλοίσβοιο</foreign> (vs. 34) is an onomatopoetic word,
by the use of which we are made to hear the rattle of the arrows of the

αὐτοῦ</foreign> is emphatic by position. It is none less than the mighty god himself who is now before us. <foreign xml:lang="greek">νυκτὶ ἐοικώς:</foreign> like unto night, both in swiftness of coming and in the awful gloom and dread which night brings to primitive peoples who have no adequate lighting facilities. This expression visualizes his appearance for the eye, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔκλαγξαν</foreign> presents his coming to the ear.

The poet thus makes definite and clear the picture he is seeking to paint.

49. <foreign xml:lang="greek">δεινή</foreign> : terrifying. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κλαγγή:</foreign> onomatopoetic. We thus hear the clang of the bow. The rhythm of the verse, especially toward the end, helps in producing this effect. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">βιοῖο:</foreign> gen. of source, <ref>987</ref>.

50. <foreign xml:lang="greek">πρῶτον</foreign> : <ref>780</ref>—781. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐπῴχετο [ἐπ-οίχομαι] 

ἀργούς</foreign> : swift as a silvery
flash, a highly picturesque way of presenting the effect upon the eye
of the swift glancing motion of the feet of dogs as they run.

This passage gives accurately the ordinary course of such plagues,
where the poet, perhaps without realizing it, follows closely the results
of modern medical science, in establishing the fact that such pestilences
usually attack animals first, and from these the contagion would spread
among human beings. During this whole procedure the god must be
thought of as seated on some high point of vantage, perhaps a convenient
cloud, or a hill in the neighborhood. He is of course invisible to the
suffering Greeks, who perhaps have not as yet suspected the real cause
of their afflictions. The clang of his bow might easily be mistaken for
thunder. To us moderns it seems rather undignified, not to say bathos,
to see the god so highly wrought up in his anger, coming down from
Olympus with all the attributes of terror, ready to visit destruction upon
the Greeks for their insult (through Agamemnon) to his priest, seat
himself and turn his implements of death upon the mules and dogs of
the camp, who had done him no wrong. This seems to be due to the
fusion of two conceptions: 1) the poetic description of the wrath of the
revengeful god, preparing to destroy those who have insulted his priest,
and 2) the actual description of the usual course of a plague.

51. <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτοῖσι:</foreign> <ref>1004</ref>, the men (their masters), as contrasted with the
animals, <ref>1041.6</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">βέλος σεχεπευκές</foreign>  originally, <ref>1167.2</ref> (<ref>1168</ref>) ; <ref>603-604</ref>; <ref>619</ref>. <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτοῖσι</foreign> refers of course to the Greeks, and brings them into sharp
prominence. “ The plague did not stop with the animals, but even
attacked their masters.”

<pb n="55"/>

52. <foreign xml:lang="greek">βάλλ’</foreign> is emphatic by position, by the following pause, by the prolonged
sound of the trilled <foreign xml:lang="greek">λλ</foreign> (making it onomatopoetic), and by meaning
(imperfect). The imperfect represents a series of repeated actions.
Observe how vividly the poet presents to the eye the great number of
deaths due to the arrows of the god. We can see the funeral pyres,
with their heaps of corpses, burning on every side.

On this whole passage, compare what Lessing says in the Laocoon,
when discussing some of the fundamental differences between the art of
the painter and that of the poet. “ The picture of the plague. What
do we see on the canvas? Dead bodies, the flame of funeral pyres, the
dying busied with the dead, the angry god upon a cloud discharging his
arrows. The profuse wealth of the picture becomes poverty in the poet.
Now let us turn to Homer himself. The poet here is as far beyond the
painter as life is better than a picture. Wrathful, with bow and quiver,
Apollo descends from the Olympian towers. I not only see him, but
hear him. At every step the arrows rattle on the shoulders of the angry
god. He enters among the host like the night. Now he seats himself
over against the ships, and with a terrible clang of the silver bow sends
his first shaft against the mules and dogs. Next he turns his poisoned
(deadly) darts upon the warriors themselves, and unceasing blaze on
every side the corpse-laden pyres. It is impossible to translate into any
other language the musical painting heard in the poet’s words.”

The stage is now all set for the introduction of the hero, the divine
Achilles, who henceforth plays a prominent part, and is never wholly
lost sight of for the rest of the poem.

ἐπὶ <foreign xml:lang="greek">φρεσὶ θῆκε Ἥρη:</foreign> Achilles has an idea, which is
represented by the poet as an inspiration from heaven. Such was a
common belief regarding any plan which later developments showed to
be fraught with more than ordinary consequences, but this of course
could only be known after the events had transpired. “Now the city
was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses
were not builded. And my God put it into my heart to gather together
the nobles, and the rulers, and the people.” “And I arose in the night,
I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God
had put into my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast
with me, save the beast that I rode upon.” “And during supper, the
devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, to betray him. . . .”

It is just as well not to ask why Agamemnon, the leader of the forces,
who apparently was not yet aware of the cause of the plague, did not
summon this assembly. The poet explains it by saying that Hera was
responsible, and he thus frees Achilles from any blame in the matter.

Achilles is brought before us in a few verses as a chivalrous and generous-hearted
warrior, and is contrasted with the selfish, grasping, and
brutal Agamemnon. The poet does all this by indirection, with a very
few words, yet so skillfully that henceforth the sympathies of the
audience are with the hero.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">λευκώλενος</foreign> : the poet keenly senses the features of his objects which
are distinctive and characteristic, and which visualize them best for his
hearers. Thus when he says while-armed (λευκώλενος) Hera, one cannot


<pb n="58"/>

help seeing a beautiful and stately queen, with shining white arms.
In the same way, the ships are swift (vs. 12), and hollow (vs. 26),
Achilles swift-footed (vs. 58), Apollo a sharp-shooter (vss. 14, 21), and is a
god with a silver how (vs. 37), the Achaeans are well-greaved (vs. 17), the
ransoms shining (vs. 23), the sea loud-resounding (vs. 34), Leto flowing-haired
(vs. 36), the thigh-pieces of bulls and goats fat (vs. 40), Apollo’s
quiver covered at both ends (vs. 45), his bow silver (vs. 49, cf. vs. 37), his
arrows biting (vs. 51), and the dog's are swift as a silvery flash, (vs. 50).

56. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Δαναῶν</foreign> : <ref>984</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁράτο</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὡράετο</foreign>, <ref>584-585</ref>; <ref>837</ref> ; middle of interest, <ref>1067.2-1067.3</ref>.

difficulty of any kind arose among uncivilized peoples, it was customary
to consult a specialist in theology, a priest, a prophet, or any one
to whom the lord had revealed his will directly or indirectly, as through
dreams. The true significance of dreams could be known only by those
to whom the god had given the faculty of interpreting them, as to
Joseph and to Daniel. Read <bibl>1 Sam. ix, 3-10</bibl>, and <bibl>2 Kings 1, 2-3</bibl>. <foreign xml:lang="greek">—

The abrupt action of Achilles in thus bluntly addressing his commander
in chief, and apparently without previous consultation with him,
practically demanding before all the common soldiers that the expedition
should be given up and that all should return home, is most remarkable
and is sure to be resented by Agamemnon. But then Hera is
to blame (read the note on vs. 55). Thus the poet gives good and
sufficient grounds for the righteous indignation of Agamemnon, and at
the same time prevents the sympathies of his audience from being
alienated from the hero.

66-67. The doubtful tone here shows that Achilles does not feel at
all certain that they will be successful in their appeal to the free-shooter.
Of course if the god has been offended, he must first be appeased before
he will listen to their prayer or accept their offering, “ for the sacrifice
of the wicked is an abomination unto Jehovah.” “ Hear, O earth:
behold I will bring evil upon this people . . . , because they have not
hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.” “ To what
purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane
from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your
sacrifices sweet unto me.” But if they once succeeded in allaying the
hot wrath of their god, the best way to win favor with him was to give
him a good dinner of nice roast lamb or kid. “ And he shall say, Where
are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted; who did eat the fat
of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?” “And
when thou preparest a bullock for the sacrifice, in performing a vow, or
peace offerings unto Jehovah: then shall he bring with a bullock a food
offering of three tenths of an ephah of flour, mingled with half an hin
of oil.” Of course the animals offered in sacrifice must be of the choicest,
fat and sleek, with no blemish or disease whatsoever.

Seeing that everything is going to ruin, Achilles suggests to Agamemnon,
commander in chief of the allied expedition, that they attempt
to save at least the lives of those remaining. The only way he sees of
doing this is to abandon the undertaking and return home. He suggests
further that they consult some holy man of God, who may tell
them what the trouble is and help them to avert the anger of the
divinity from those who are still alive.

It is characteristic of the psychology of primitive peoples to see in
the operations of nature the direct action of their gods, beings created
in their own image, with feelings and passions like unto their own. If
good fortune befell a people it was a mark of the special favor of their
divinity; if evil came it was a sign of his displeasure, and some one had
sinned, whom the god was seeking to punish. “ And Nathan said to
David, . . . Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of Jehovah,
to do evil in his sight ? . . . Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast
given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child
also that is born unto thee shall surely die. . . . And it came to pass

<pb n="64"/>

on the seventh day, that the child died.” “ Then there was a famine in
the days of David, three years, year after year; and David inquired of
Jehovah. And Jehovah answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody
house, because he slew the Gibeonites.” “ But the men of Sodom were
wicked and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly. . . . Then Jehovah
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from
Jehovah out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain,
and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
ground.” “ So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
men: and they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai smote of
them about thirty and six men : for they chased them from before the
gate even unto Shebarim. . . . And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to
the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah. . , . And Jehovah
said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which
I commanded them : for they have taken even of the accursed thing. . . .
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies,
but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed.
Neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed
from among you.”

68-69. Although not called upon by name, Calchas here comes
dramatically forward, not from any egotism, but from a proper self-evaluation.
Homer’s heroes seem to have had little of that mock
modesty, humility, and self-depreciation in vogue to-day, which as
found in our own modern life seems to be primarily of Semitic ancestry.<note n="grc">ouch.</note>
“ And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto Jehovah, which am but dust and ashes.” “ How then
can man be just with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a
woman? Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are
not pure in his sight: how much less man, that is a worm! and the son
of man which is a worm! ” “ But I am a worm, and no man; a
 reproach of men, and despised of the people.”

69. <foreign xml:lang="greek">οἰωνοπόλων:</foreign> birds, especially high-flying ones, which went up to
heaven, might reasonably be expected to become acquainted at times
with the will of the gods. This knowledge could be gained by mortals
who knew how to interpret their movements and cries, or who had
learned their language, as in Hebrew legend Solomon is reputed to
have done. “And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the
children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. Por he was wiser
than all men. And he spake with trees, from the cedar that is in

undertaking as the guiding of the ships for so great a distance,
through strange seas, could only be accomplished by the direct assistance
of the god, just as the Israelites were guided by Jehovah in their long
and difficult journey to Palestine. A soothsayer regularly accompanied
all ancient military expeditions, to interpret the will of the gods, and to
guide the people aright. In many cases they doubtless had superior
knowledge, which would help to explain their hold on the masses.
“ Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” “ And there
arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew
face to face.” “ And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them,
... I have led you forty years in the wilderness.” “ Thou leddest thy
people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.” — <foreign xml:lang="greek">μαντοσύνην</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὴν οἱ πόρε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων</foreign> : that is, he was a prophet inspired of his god, an

in his stepping forward. In fact this was the only proper course for him
to pursue, and was thought of as perfectly natural by all concerned.
Owing to later developments, Agamemnon would be perfectly justified
in suspecting a collusion between him and Achilles.

Observe the spondaic ending, which brings this verse, and particularly
the last word, into strong prominence, as being of more than ordinary

to the words of Calchas.

πρόφρων: observe that the Greek uses the adjective
where the English idiom would ordinarily prefer the adverb. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσὶν:</foreign> <ref>1005</ref>. The prophet signifies his willingness to impart the desired
information, but knowing the truth will hurt, he requests a sworn
pledge and an assurance of protection. As he will have to indicate that
Agamemnon is guilty, and as all are well aware of the violent temperament
of the son of Atreus, he makes the legitimate demand that Achilles
will not merely stand and talk while the god’s holy prophet is being
roughly handled. Observe in vs. 76 the emphasis placed upon <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">σύ
(</foreign>which are always emphatic when expressed, since they are contained in
the personal endings of the verb and are ordinarily omitted). “<emph>I</emph> am

It has always been dangerous to arouse the
wrath of a king or of a god; for even though
they did not exact vengeance immediately they
would hold the grudge, sometimes even to the
third and fourth generation of the children of
the sinner, till they had obtained full satisfaction.
Then, too, when once their wrath was
kindled, they were notoriously and recklessly
cruel in revenging themselves. “ The wrath of
a king is as messengers of death, but a wise
man will pacify it.” “ The king’s wrath is as
the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew
upon the grass.” “Kiss the son (i.e. the king),
lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled
but a little.” “And when the people complained it displeased Jehovah:

and Jehovah heard it: and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of Jehovah
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost
parts of the camp.”

The seer really had more power than Agamemnon, who is compelled
to yield to him, as we learn in the sequel; but he does not wish to
expose himself unnecessarily either to any rashness on the part of the
king in his hot wrath nor to his plotting afterward, should he cherish a
grudge.

<p>86. <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ μὰ γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνα</foreign> (ὄμνῡμι) : this is the answer of
Achilles to the demand of Calchas that he swear, (ὄμοσσον, vs. 76) to protect
him. He meets the issue fairly and promises frankly. — 

ᾦ <foreign xml:lang="greek">τε</foreign> [ὅς <foreign xml:lang="greek">τε</foreign>, ἥ <foreign xml:lang="greek">τε</foreign>, ὅ <foreign xml:lang="greek">τε].

</foreign><pb n="75"/>

87. Prayer was one of the means by which a prophet could learn the
will of his God. “And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. And Jehovah
said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people.” “ The prayer
of a righteous man availeth much.” 

86—87. ᾧ <foreign xml:lang="greek">τε.</foreign> . . <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀναφαίνεις</foreign> parenthetic.

88: <ref>994</ref>. There is of course the definite promise here that Achilles
is willing to defend the safety of Calchas, even with his own life, if need
be. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> of this verse repeats the <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> of vs. 86, for the sake of clearness
after the long intervening parenthetic clause. This verse is another
good example of epic fullness of expression, a form of pleonasm, used to
make the statement more emphatic aud impressive.

89. <foreign xml:lang="greek">σοί:</foreign> <ref>1004</ref>. Merely a picturesque way of saying that no one shall
strike the seer.

90. Achilles is specific in naming Agamemnon, where the more prudent
and cautious Calchas had been content to use general terms in
describing him, without taking the risk of calling him by name.

91. This is of course not egotism on the part of Agamemnon (cf.
note on vs. 68 ff.), but merely a naive recognition of his own worth.
He was not without a certain amount of competition in this matter,
however, as Achilles modestly claims this honor (of being <foreign>ἄριστος
Ἀχαιῶν</foreign>) for himself (vs. <ref>224</ref>) ; and, for the purposes of the poet, various
leaders of the Greeks might on differing occasions be considered worthy
to bear this title. It is part of the superlative and hyperbolic language
of epic, cf. the note to vs. 15, § <ref>90</ref>, and to vs. 70, § <ref>176</ref>.

With these words Achilles takes the final step which must provoke
Agamemnon beyoud all measure. Carried away by his own generous
enthusiasm in protecting the defenseless, he sets himself up as the equal
of his commander in chief, and thus leads inevitably onward to the
bitter quarrel which ensues.

Achilles swears by the patron god of Calchas himself that no harm
shall befall the prophet, and that he is willing to risk his own life in
his defense, even though he accuse Agamemnon, whose violent and
reckless wrath was a matter of common knowledge. Such a promise
was naturally to be expected from Achilles’ impetuously generous character.
With this assurance the prophet is ready to disclose the will of
the god and the cause of all their woe.

It was once a matter of common belief that if any one swore by a
god and then proved false to his oath, the divinity involved would punish
him with all due severity. For that reason an oath was considered
as binding by those who would have no hesitation in breaking their
word. There is a peculiar fitness in swearing by Apollo here, not only

<pb n="76"/>

as the patron god of Calchas, but he is destroying the Greeks with his
arrows, and Achilles would be inviting a special dispensation of his
wrath npon himself should he fail to keep his vow. “ And ye shall not
swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God:
I am Jehovah.” “ If a man vow a vow unto Jehovah, or swear an oath
to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.” “ Thou shalt fear
Jehovah thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.” “ Thou
shalt not swear falsely by the name of Jehovah thy God; for Jehovah
will not hold him guiltless that sweareth falsely by his name.” “ Jehovah
hath sworn and will not repent.”

When Agamemnon claims to be “far the best of the Achaeans,” he
uses “ best ” in the Irish sense, of being able to overcome any one there
in a fair fight.

92. <foreign xml:lang="greek">θάρσησε:</foreign> took courage: inceptive aorist, <ref>1081</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ηὖδα</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ηὔδαε [αὐδάω]</foreign>, <ref>584-585</ref>. The seer, realizing that Achilles is the type of man
“ that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not,” is emboldened to
speak out unambiguously.

<p>93. <foreign xml:lang="greek">εὐχωλῆς</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑκατόμβης</foreign> : <ref>979.6</ref>.

94. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀρητῆρος:</foreign> emphatic by position, and placed in strict contrast
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">εὐχωλῆς</foreign>, as both occupy the same position in the verse. “ Perhaps
you thought it was a vow or a hecatomb, but no, it was a priest.” Observe
how the seer waits till the last possible moment in his sentence
before speaking the name of Agamemnon, which might seem to indicate
his fear of him, but at the same time would bring this word into special
prominence.

94-95. The prophet first makes the general statement that the priest
was insulted, and follows this by citing two specific features.

96. <quote>τούνεκ’</quote> (τούνεκα) sums up the preceding and brings it out prominently,
so that there can be no mistaking what the real cause of the trouble is.

It has always been dangerous to insult a holy man of God. “ And
Elisha went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked
him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and
tare in pieces forty and two children of them.”

97. <quote xml:lang="greek">Δαναοῖσιν</quote>: <ref>997</ref>.—

<quote xml:lang="greek">ὅ <foreign xml:lang="greek">γε</foreign></quote> resumes the subject, Apollo, with emphasis.
96-97 : perhaps the rhyme at the end of these two verses is intentional,
to bring these two words into full relief and sharp contrast with
each other.

98. The subject of <gloss>δόμεναι</gloss> may be the Greeks, but more likely it is
intended to refer to Agamemnon, and would thus be omitted on purpose
by the priest, who is afraid of his anger, in spite of the assurance of
Achilles. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑλικώπιδα:</foreign> <gloss>bright-eyes</gloss>, is another of those speaking epithets
which brings the object vividly before the mind, and helps to
explain Agamemnon’s infatuation for the girl with her flashing eyes,
that sparkled with the fullness of rippling laughter.

97-98. <foreign xml:lang="greek">πρὶν</foreign> . . . <foreign xml:lang="greek">πρίν:</foreign> <gloss>he will not sooner drive off pestilence . . . till
(we) give back ....</gloss> <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον:</foreign> <gloss>without money and without

reparation must be made before the god will consider any peace
terms.

100. ἐς <foreign xml:lang="greek">Χρύσην:</foreign> into Chrysa, the town, not to Chryses, the priest.
Calchas is evidently not willing to guarantee that they will succeed in
appeasing the god by following his prescription, as the action of the
divinity is dependent upon his own arbitrary free will, and hence uncertain.
This type of statement has the further advantage of leaving a
loophole of escape for the priest, who would thus preserve inviolate his
reputation for infallibility. Theoretically it should be possible to persuade
the god, as Homer says in another place (where an old friend of
Achilles is trying to induce him to forego his anger against Agamemnon): “ Therefore, Achilles, rule thy high spirit; neither doth it befit
thee to have a ruthless heart. Nay, even the very gods can bend, and
theirs withal is loftier majesty and honor and might. Their hearts by
incense and reverent vows and drink-offerings and burnt offerings men
turn with prayer, so oft as any transgresseth and doeth sin.<foreign xml:lang="greek">”.—

πεπίθοιμεν:</foreign> <ref>1105</ref>.

This speech of Calchas is a fine example of good oratory. First, he
disabuses the minds of his hearers of their prepossessions (they thought
the god might be offended because of some vow unfulfilled, or of some
hecatomb unoffered), and after thus clearing the way and having his
audience ask of themselves what then was the trouble with the freeshooter,
he gives the real reason, which strikes home and carries so
much conviction with it that Agamemnon, in spite of his angry opposition,
is compelled to bow, and to acknowledge that it is the finger of
god which forces him to yield his prize.

<div type="textpart" n="205">
<p>Translate:

1. Do the gods blame the Achaeans on account of a vow, or of a hecatomb, or on account of Chryses the priest, whom Agamemnon dishonored ? 

2. If Agamemnon will not release the dear daughter of the aged priest and receive the shining ransoms, the free-shooter will still give many woes to the Danaans, nor will he ward off unseemly destruction for them until they give back to her own father the white-armed maiden, unbought, and unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb into Chrysa ; then perhaps they may appease the god and persuade his soul.

103 f. The diaphragm was thought of as the seat of the emotions and
evil passions, just as the word “heart” is still used in English. “For
out of the heart proceed evil thoughts.” The dark cloud first gathers
in Agamemnon’s breast, before bursting in full fury upon Calchas. This
scene demonstrates that the seer well knew what he was about (ὃς <foreign xml:lang="greek">ᾔδη
τὰ τ’ ἐόντα</foreign>, etc., vs. 70) when he demanded protection of Achilles before
making his accusation of the king.

105. <foreign xml:lang="greek">πρώτιστα</foreign> : <ref>780</ref>—781. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κάκ’:</foreign> <ref>780-781</ref>, <ref>1012</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κάκ’ ὀσσόμενος</foreign> :
“with evil look” (literally “looking evil things”), i.e. a look that
boded trouble for Calchas. <foreign xml:lang="greek">—

πρώτιστα:</foreign> a double superlative, as “most
unkindest, most highest, chiefest,” etc.

This description of the wrathful Agamemnon, with eyes flashing fire
and foreboding evil, could be applied with exceptional fitness and without
any change to an angry lion, ready to spring upon the object of its
rage, which picture was perhaps more or less actively present in the
poet’s consciousness when he composed this passage.

106. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὸ κρήγυον Ϝεῖπας</foreign> is unmetrical. Perhaps <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὰ κρήγυα Ϝεῖπας</foreign> stood
here originally. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἶπας:</foreign> <ref>865.3</ref>. “ I hate him, for he doth not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil.” Many see in this and the following

<pb n="82"/>

verses a reference to the events at Aulis, where in accordance with the
commands of Calchas Agamemnon was compelled to sacrifice his own
daughter, Iphigeneia, before the gods would send suitable winds for the
Greek fleet to set sail for Troy.

107. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τοι</foreign> echoes the <foreign xml:lang="greek">μοι</foreign> of the preceding verse, with which it is contrasted.
— <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὰ κάκ’ ἐστί:</foreign> <ref>973.1</ref>.

106-108. Agamemnon’s fury is aroused as he thinks he detects a plot
(of which Calchas and Achilles are the ringleaders) to rob him of his
prize. Apparently he has slight heed for priests and prophets and holy
men. His whole attitude toward the seer is one of burning scorn and
bitter sarcasm. Although he does not use the word, he forcibly suggests
that Calchas is a liar. “ Should thy lies make men hold their peace?”
“ Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination
? ” Besides, the gods could be dishonest at times. Thus Zeus sends
a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, and Jehovah might send a lying
spirit to deceive the prophets. It may be that the poet would represent
here a phase of the age-long struggle between rationalism (Agamemnon)
and religion (Calchas). <ref>106</ref>-108 are merely the ordinary exaggeration
common to the heat of passion.

More commonly known as the "Venus of Milo.” The statue was discovered
in <ref>1820</ref> a.d. on the island of Melos. It consists of two principal
pieces, joined together across the folds of the drapery. Most art critics date
this work about <ref>100</ref> b.c. The strong, serene figure of the god dees sets forth

<p>109. In vss. 106 ff. Agamemnon makes sweeping general charges
against Calchas; in vs. 109 he proceeds to the particular, <foreign xml:lang="greek">καὶ νῦν</foreign>, as proof
of his assertions.

110. ὡς: <ref>1154.1</ref>. The whole attitude of Agamemnon toward Calchas
is one of sneering disbelief.

111. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐγώ:</foreign> emphatic, since Calchas had claimed that it was Agamemnon,
and no other, who was to blame for the plague. Naturally Agamemnon makes out as good a case as possible for himself, and mentions
only the rejection of the ransoms, and has nothing to say of the insults
which he had heaped upon the old priest, and the affront he had shown
to the god. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κούρης:</foreign> <ref>979.5</ref>.

112. <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτήν:</foreign> the girl’s own self, as contrasted with the ransom. <foreign xml:lang="greek">—
βούλομαι:</foreign> prefer. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">πολύ</foreign> : <ref>780-781</ref>.

113. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ῥα Κλυταιμ(v</foreign>)ήστρης: <ref>524</ref>, <ref>988</ref>. The correct spelling of this
name is <foreign xml:lang="greek">Κλυταιμήστρη</foreign>, although practically all modern texts have <foreign xml:lang="greek">Κλυταιμνήστρη</foreign>, and we ordinarily have “ Clytaemnestra ” in English.

114. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑθέν [ἕο]</foreign> : <ref>993</ref>. When Chryseis is said to be no worse than Clytaem(n)estra,
it is only another way of saying that she is much more
preferable.

115. <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέμας</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">φυήν</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">φρένας</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔργα</foreign> (Ϝέργα) : <ref>1014</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">τι:</foreign> <ref>780-781</ref>.

After sneering at Calchas, Agamemnon hastens to add his own defense
for not accepting the ransoms and releasing the girl. He is careful
however not to mention his own brutal speech to the priest. Evidently
he is in love with Chryseis, who is much younger than his own wife
whom he had married in the days of his youth (κουριδίης), a situation
of the sort which has produced many of the world’s most interesting

<pb n="85"/>

tragedies. Apparently he would be more than willing to get rid of
Clytaem(n)estra and marry the girl. Unfortunately we are left entirely
in the dark as to how this was to be done. It would be interesting to
know whether Agamemnon has in mind some practical means of disposing
of Clytaem(n)estra, as by divorce, or whether this is merely a vision
of an unrealizable happiness, and he can only live on in the vague hope
that perhaps she may die first. Perhaps it is only another example of
“Maggie, my wife at fifty, grey and dour and old, with never another
Maggie to be purchased for love or gold.” <note>Kipling</note> By a tragic sort of ironical
poetic justice, Clytaem(n)estra settled accounts with Agamemnon upon
his return home, by murdering him, having proved as unfaithful to him
as he had been to her in his absence. This would of course be brought
vividly to the minds of Homer’s hearers when Agamemnon here mentions
her name.

115 ff. Instead of dealing in generalities, Agamemnon specifies the
qualities which make Chryseis seem lovely and desirable in his eyes.
By <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέμας</foreign> he refers to her stately build. The old Greeks never seem to
have found the petite particularly adorable, and they especially admired
women of large and imposing stature. By <foreign xml:lang="greek">φνήν</foreign> he refers to grace of
form and feature, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">φρένας</foreign> probably means that she was of an affectionate
disposition, implying a marked contrast in this respect with his
own Clytaem(n)estra. In other words, “Maggie is pretty to look at,
Maggie’s a loving lass.” And then, to crown all, he refers to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔργα</foreign>, her
accomplishments. These were not of the highly impractical sort sometimes
found in modern times, but the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔργα</foreign> of this young lady, which
found such a responsive chord in Agamemnon’s soul, were housewifely
accomplishments. She was doubtless a good cook (“For beauty won’t
help if vittles is cold, and Love ain’t enough for a soldier”), could spin
and weave, kept his soldier hut neat and clean, and saw to it that his
clothes were kept properly mended.

116. <foreign xml:lang="greek">καί:</foreign> even. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἰ τό γ’ ἄμεινον</foreign> (ἐστιν) : Agamemnon still would
intimate that it is not for the best, and takes advantage of this opportunity
for another innuendo at the honesty of the seer.

117. ἤ : rather than.

Seeing that he has to give her up, Agamemnon makes the best of the
situation, and by the addition of the last two verses (116-117) effectively
wins over the common soldiery to his side, an important consideration
in subsequent developments. This is a good speech and well worked
out in every way.

The <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign> of vs. 117 echoes the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign> of vs. 11, and effectively refutes
the accusation there made.

<p>118. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐμοί:</foreign> <ref>997</ref>. It is this unreasonable demand, which Achilles

on behalf of the people feels called upon to oppose, that provokes the
fatal quarrel.

119. “Even if I should not demand a <foreign xml:lang="greek">γέρας</foreign> as justly due to me in
return for my giving back mine, common decency would require that
the king should have one, and thus not be lacking in this matter of
honor, while all the other chieftains have prizes.” The possession of
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">γέρας</foreign> was looked upon as a mark of honor due to royal station;

<pb n="88"/>

to give one was to honor the king and exalt his station; to take it away
without due recompense was felt as a keen disgrace. This the army
must prevent by giving him an equivalent for the prize he is about
to surrender. Thus Agamemnon’s demand is prompted by his feeling
of wounded honor, and by his inherent sense of the prerogatives due to
his exalted station, and not by avarice as Achilles thinks (vs. 122).
The injustice in his claim consists in his demand for immediate
(αὐτίκα) recompense, which Achilles clearly shows to be impracticable,
without committing an injustice to the others. But Achilles unfortunately
goes entirely too far in insulting the king and accusing him of
avarice beyond all other men.

120. ὅ = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὅτι: that.—

μοι:</foreign> dat. of interest, or possibly of disadvantage, <ref>997-998</ref>.

121. Achilles, who has summoned the assembly and who has promised
protection to Calchas, is the logical candidate to answer Agamemnon,
and doubtless all eyes were turned in his direction as Agamemnon finished
his harangne. The manner in which he makes his reply confirms the
suspicions of Agamemnon that he too is plotting to rob him of his
prize, and he thus draws upon himself the bolt which was ready to fall
apparently anywhere.

122. Achilles is so excited by the demand of Agamemnon that he
forgets his manners and does not show proper deference to his
commander-in-chief.

123 is a rhetorical question, and is employed as a device for stating as
strongly as possible that the great-hearted Achaeans cannot be expected
to give a prize. The two following verses explain why this is true.
The form of this question would imply that Agamemnon’s request is
absurd.

indicate that the matter is settled, and not to be reconsidered. The
Greeks had already captured and plundered many cities of the Troad,
but had not yet been able to take Troy. This verse would indicate that
they had already met with considerable successes, and that a goodly
amount of spoil had been taken and distributed among the soldiers.
This booty formed the chief inducement to the Greek warrior for engaging
upon such enterprises. In sacking the captured cities, the male
inhabitants were usually put to the sword, while the females were made

slaves and distributed to the army as prizes. “ And they warred against
the Midianites, as Jehovah had commanded Moses; and they slew all
the males. . . . And the children of Israel took all the women of
Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their
cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. And they burnt all
their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles with
fire.”

“ When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and Jehovah
thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou hast taken them
captive, and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; then thou
shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head and
pare her nails.” “ When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against
it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it shall be if it make thee answer
of peace and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that is
found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee,
then thou shalt besiege it: and when Jehovah thy God hath delivered it
into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of
the sword: but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself
; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy
God hath given thee.”

Agamemnon asserts that it is not fitting (vs. 119) that one of his rank

not fitting either (observe the force

give up all their prizes (ἔοικεν thus
being echoed by <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐπέοικε</foreign>).

to adopt a conciliatory tone,
but the angry Agamemnon is in no

offered a return of three or four hundred
per cent on his investment by
Achilles, speaking for all the Achaeans,
this is made contingent upon
the fall of Troy, which is not at all
sure, and might be at a very indefinite
future date. The appeal to
give up the girl to the god, who,
according to traditional religious
teaching, might be expected to add
some sort of reward of his own (“ and
everyone that hath forsaken houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,

trumpets. And it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast

παρελεύσεαι</foreign>  is a figure taken from the race course :
you shall not pass (me). Agamemnon begins his speech as did Achilles
(vs. 122) by addressing his opponent with a highly honorable title,
which is immediately followed by an abusive term. The fight is on,
and there is no turning back now. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">κλέπτε νόῳ</foreign>, to Agamemnon any
one who had the presumption to oppose the will of the mighty king of
men must be a scoundrel; and as Calchas was a liar (vs. 108, etc.), so
Achilles is a thief at heart. This accusation would be a grave insult to
the free and frank Achilles. On another occasion, when referring by
innuendo to Agamemnon, he says, “ For hateful to me even as the gates
of hell is he that hideth one thing in his heart and uttereth another.”
Agamemnon feels sure that Achilles is trying to steal his prize from
him secretly, by having him give her up without bestowing another
upon him. He is not satisfied with a vague promise of future recompense,
contingent upon an uncertainty, the sack of Troy. Achilles
speaks what is right and true; on the other hand, the claims of Agamemnon
are not without justice. Thus the poet with surpassing art
attributes to each the words and sentiments from which it was impossible
for the quarrel to be avoided.

133-134.
Said in scornful and bitter derision. The question is of
course “ rhetorical,” and is a much stronger presentment of his view than
if he had made the positive assertion and accusation that Achilles had
such a plan in mind. The answer of Agamemnon to the charge of covetousness
by Achilles, is that Achilles is the one who has a selfish end in
view, and that he wishes further to disgrace the commander-in-chief in
the eyes of the army by talcing away his prize of honor, while he keeps
his own. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτός</foreign> : <gloss>yourself</gloss>, as contrasted with me and my situation.

135. Agamemnon repeats the words of Achilles in verse 123, to indi-

cate his readiness to accept that plan, but with his own conditions, not
those of Achilles, and it must be done now.

136. This is perhaps pure subterfuge. Agamemnon may not be considering
the possibility he mentions here, but may have caught an evil
inspiration to rob Achilles of his prize, and so when he assails him by
demanding <foreign xml:lang="greek">μη κλέπτε νόῳ</foreign> (vss. 131-132), he may be employing a device
known the world around, of accusing his enemy of a crime which he is
contemplating himself. Probably Agamemnon makes a gesture at the
end of this verse, which would make the aposiopesis less violent.

137. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἕλωμαι:</foreign> <ref>1146</ref>. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐγώ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτός</foreign> are added with a proud feeling of
conscious superior power.

138. Observe how the addition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἰών</foreign> makes the picture definite and
adds a touch of the dramatic.

137-139. This is all more subterfuge. Agamemnon has not the
slightest intention of disturbing his two good and powerful friends,
Ajax and Odysseus, in their vested rights, but the whole passage
is aimed at Achilles. Agamemnon here mentions these two mighty
chieftains to indicate his own superiority. 139. “ I am inclined to think
that he (ὁ said with a meaning look at Achilles) may be enraged.” This
is a good example of the grimly humoresque in which Homer’s heroes
sometimes indulge. Agamemnon gloats over his ability to do as he
pleases, without having to worry over the consequences. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἵκωμαι:</foreign> <ref>1146</ref>.

141. Considering the case closed, the king calls for immediate action,
to carry out his plans as outlined. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">μέλαιναν</foreign> indicates that Homer spoke
for the eyes as well as for the ears of his audience. From the time of
“Noah’s ark” vessels were calked by a treatment of pitch, to make the
seams water-tight. This gave them the black appearance which the

146-147. To rob Achilles of his prize, and at the same time to compel
him to become an active instrument in his own undoing, at the behest
of his deadliest and most hated enemy, is the height of ironical tragedy.
Probably Agamemnon does not really intend to do this, but is only making
another attempt at a bitter and cynical jest. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱλάσσεαι:</foreign> <ref>800</ref>, <ref>1115</ref>-1116. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱερὰ ῥέξᾱς:</foreign> (by) performing sacrifices.

149. The simple-hearted Achilles takes Agamemnon’s words to be in
earnest, and thinks that they indicate a fear on the part of the king to
attempt the seizure of his prize openly, but that he is planning to send
him away on the expedition while he is accomplishing this. So he calls
Agamemnon “ crafty-minded.” — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένε</foreign> : <ref>1020.1</ref>; <ref>1071</ref>.

150-151. Of course another indignant “ rhetorical ” question, implying
that no one would be willing to obey Agamemnon any longer. Achilles
is perhaps referring primarily to himself, but the effect of this is to make
an indirect appeal to whatever there might be of latent rebellion among
the soldiery against such high-handed injustice.

154. <foreign xml:lang="greek">βοῦς</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">βόας</foreign> : throughout all history cattle have been an important
economic factor. Thus the English words “ fee, chattel, pecuniary,”
etc., indicate the part they have played in our own and in the Roman
monetary systems, as a medium of exchangee, before the introduction of
coinage. In Homer’s time maidens were called cattle-bringing, because
their suitors regularly gave cattle to their fathers as a wedding present,
in return for the girl as a wife. A useful woman in Homeric times
might be worth as much as four cows. Their great importance has
made them an object of divine worship among many peoples, as among
the old Hebrews, who for a long period of their history worshipped a
bull-god, of which the horns of the altar were a survival.

155. <foreign xml:lang="greek">βωτιανείρῃ:</foreign> observe the touch of local pride, so common throughout
all nations. His home produces heroes, of which he is one. The
ornamental epithets and picturesque language may indicate how dear to
his heart his old home in Phthia was. Perhaps he is almost homesick.

ἠχήεσσα:</foreign> onomatopoetic, to represent the sound of the roaring
sea.—

<foreign xml:lang="greek">σκιόεντα</foreign> refers to the long shadows which high mountains throw.
This verse is in apposition with <foreign xml:lang="greek">πολλά</foreign> (used substantively) of the
preceding verse.

Observe the heaping up of the first personal pronouns in this passage,
to indicate that Achilles had no personal interest, as did Agamemnon,
in the expedition.<note n="grc">can we show that this is statistically significant? Note that we have egw and moi as well as emas -- different lemmas</note> Achilles emphasizes his own generous motives and
self-sacrificing spirit in joining the undertaking, thereby throwing into
high relief the ingratitude of Agamemnon and the deep injustice of his
selfishness. “ The Trojans have never done me the slightest harm, that

I should have gone to all this trouble in making this expedition against
them.”

154 ff. Such wanton robbery and destruction of property might he
either the occasion or the result of war. The origin of the Homeric
wars, as most wars before and since,
had ultimately an economic basis,
and they were waged either to protect
their own property or to gain
possession of that of their neighbors.

“And the children of Israel did that
which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them
into the hand of Midian seven
years. . . . And so it was when
Israel had sown, that the Midianites
came up, and the Amalekites, and
the children of the East, even they came up against them; and they
encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou
comest to Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor
ox, nor ass.” “ And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and
the men of Jericho fought against you. . . ; and I delivered them into
your hand. . . . And I have given you a land for which ye did not
labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards
and olive trees which ye planted
not do ye eat. Now therefore fear Jehovah
and serve him.” “And Joshua did
unto them as Jehovah bade him: he
houghed their horses, and burnt their
chariots with fire. . . . And all the spoil
of these cities, and the cattle, the children
of Israel took for a prey unto themselves;
but every man they smote with the edge
of the sword, until they had destroyed
them, neither left they any to breathe.”

156-157. Achilles is not strictly logical; for in spite of the crashing sea that
rolled between, he was doing in Troy
the very thing which he says the Trojans
have never done in his land because of the intervening distance.<foreign xml:lang="greek">—

prominence by its position in the verse, since Agamemnon wishes to
make clear to Achilles the limits of his authority, and that he has no
right to be issuing commands to the Achaeans. Agamemnon will bear
no infringement of his own prerogatives.

181. KOTtovTos (rco) : 984.

In this whole passage Agamemnon assumes a tone of sneering sarcasm
and contempt for Achilles, as though he were but a peevish and willful
child. Thus he belittles Achilles’ every motive and excellence. His
threat to return home is interpreted as due to panicky fear, his bravery
in war, his impetuous spirit, and his strength of will, are all qualities
which make him a nuisance as a quarrelsome and contentious fellow.
“Pray don’t let me detain you,” he says, “if you are in such a hurry to
flee. It will be a blessing to see you gone, since you are so perverse and
given to strife. Be sure to take all your bags and baggage along, and
don’t be trying to strut around here with your authority, but run along
home to the Myrmidons, where you belong. Pout away all you please.
Your anger is the least of my worries. It is all the same to me whether
you hold a grudge or not, and just to show you how much I care, I shall
threaten you as follows: ” This all proves too much for Achilles, who
feels now that he cannot return home without provoking the ridicule of

pretends that it would give him pleasure to be rid of him, he insists
upon staying.

The situation has now reached the point where Achilles feels constrained
to act, as he would rather die than endure such deep insults and
humiliation at the hands of his most despised enemy. The imperfects
in the first two verses make the description strikingly vivid and picturesque,
while the hurried action of the two following aorists are well
adapted to introduce Athena suddenly and dramatically. The appearance
of Athena is as unexpected, and is
introduced with as much dramatic effect
as the intervention of the angel when
Ahraham was getting ready to perform
the final act in the sacrifice of Isaac:

“ And Abraham stretched forth his hand,
and took the knife to slay his son. And
the angel of Jehovah called unto him out
of heaven, and said, Ahraham, Abraham:
and he said, Here am I. And he said,

Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither
do thou anything unto him.”

197. <foreign xml:lang="greek">κόμης:</foreign> 983.

198. <foreign xml:lang="greek">οϊω</foreign> (Άχιλψ) : divinities regularly
had the power of making themselves invisible
to part of a company and appearing
only to one or more in whom they
had some special interest. “ And I
Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men
that were with me saw not the vision.”

“ And the angel of Jehovah stood in the
way for an adversary against him. . . .

And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah,
standing in the way, and his sword
drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went
into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.”
The Homeric divinity never appears to a group, hut only to individuals.
Besides it would have spoiled the plot had Athena been seen or heard
by the other Greeks, including Agamemnon.

The latter part of this verse repeats in negative form the first two
words. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">όράτο</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ώράίτο</foreign>, <ref>584-585</ref>, 837.

Greeks who would have dared to attempt it. Even though it might
seem highly undignified in a goddess, no time was to be lost and words
would probably have had little effect on the headlong Achilles. Besides
it gives the poet an unusual opportunity for introducing a picturesquely
dramatic incident.

202. <foreign xml:lang="greek">αἰγιόχοιο:</foreign> the aegis of Zeus was a shield, adorned with the head
of the Gorgon, a snaky-headed monster, which petrified with chilly fear
all who looked upon it. Athena was the best beloved of the children of
Zeus, since she had sprung, as goddess of wisdom, full grown and fully
armed from his head. As his favorite child she often bore his aegis.
Achilles seems displeased at Athena’s interf erence, and is greatly vexed
that he should be prevented from killing Agamemnon. — aSrt does not
of necessity refer to an earlier appearance of Athena, but may merely
denote Achilles’ impatience that one trouble after another seems to
have befallen him; and so he says, “And have you come too” (as an
addition to all my other vexations) ?

<p>202) by a second rhetorical one. Hybris was something always to be
punished by the gods, “ for the froward is an abomination to Jehovah.”
If Athena wished to be sure as to Agamemnon’s hybris, the best way was
for her to come down and see for herself. “ And Jehovah said, Because
the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very
grievous; I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
know.” %

Its origin was lost sight of before the time of Homer, to whom
she was gleaming-eyed, flashing-eyed, etc., but it represents the earlier idea,
according to which the goddess was thought of in the form of an owl,
just as Jehovah was worshipped by the Israelites for a long time in the
form of a bull-god, as Apollo Smintheus was once the mouse-god, etc.

the further action and development of the poem, would be an artistic

and do not consort so freely with mortals as they do in the Iliad.

Beginning with vs. 224, Achilles now feels free to answer Agamemnon
; and so he pours out his wrath, makes a prophecy of the future,
and sits down, while Agamemnon remains silent, possibly because 'he is
speechless from rage. Achilles employs no word of honor in his address
this time, but laj7s to with the most abusive epithets at his command.
In his anger, he is guilty of untruthful exaggeration in charging
Agamemnon with drunkenness, shamelessness, and cowardice. As a
matter of fact, Agamemnon was brave as a lion.

heaven,” etc. Thus Shakespere’s characters swear by their beards.
Achilles swears by the sceptre as a symbol of his royal power, with the
implication that he hopes to lose it if he swears falsely. Slightly different
is the implication when he swears by Apollo (vs. 86). See the note
there, 197. The gods swore by the river Styx. The gist of this whole
passage is “ as surely as this sceptre shall never sprout forth leaves and

Homer goes quietly on, here introducing a description which vivifies the

need not feel compelled to infer therefrom that every sceptre mentioned
by Homer as golden was merely studded with golden rivets, as the poet
does not feel obliged to be strongly and carefully consistent, but always
feels free to vary according to the necessity of the situation and the effect
he wished to produce. Thus the gods are at times strictly anthropomorphic,
with very human limitations, at other times they are thought of as

pivov:</foreign> this addition by way of description in the moment of greatest
suspense is characteristic of the objectivity of the poet’s art. He is so
little touched personally by the content of what he relates, that he makes
his way undisturbed through the strife of the kings without taking sides,
and in the midst of the greatest excitement he still has an eye for details.
He sees not only the wrath of the chieftains but also the golden heads
of the nails, driven into the sceptre as a crude sort of ornament. It may
be too that the poet wished to increase the
tension by keeping his audience in suspense
a moment longer, before telling them what
happened next.

degree of sweetness was involved. “ What is sweeter than honey ? and
what is stronger than a lion?” “The judgments of Jehovah are true
and righteous altogether. More to he desired are they than, gold, yea
than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.”
“My son, eat thou honey, because it is good ; and the honeycomb which
is sweet to the taste.” “How sweet are thy words to my taste! Yea,
sweeter than honey to my mouth! ” “ Thy lips, 0 my bride, drop as
the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue.” “ I have eaten
my honeycomb with my honey.”

The son of Atreus kept rag ing at the divine son of Peleus ; but Nestor, who was kindly disposed toward all the Achaeans, sprang up and addressed them (with) winged words, which were much sweeter than honey. 4. The sweet-speaking Nestor, the clear-toned ora tor of the Pylians, harangued all the Achaeans with many words. 5. Words sweeter than honey flow from the tongue of the aged warrior.

<p>250. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τώ:</foreign> 998. The figure of Nestor has become proverbial for
very old age. Reckoning a generation at about a third of a century, as
did the ancient Greeks, he -would be somewhere between seventy and a
hundred years of age. This is an imaginative touch of the poet, to
obtain a necessary character for a particular rSle, and does not require a
rational explanation^ He had lived long and experienced much, and
had no aversion to telling long stories of his earlier experiences, and to
offering all sorts of good advice, which was rarely acted upon. He is
one of the best drawn of Homer’s characters. Like old Polonius, he
was wordy and futile. Since brevity was the soul of wit, he would be
brief — with many words, and proffer his advice, in and out of season,
usually to the irritation of all concerned.

of these is the rel. pron., nom. plur. masc., referring to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ανθρώπων</foreign>, vs. 250 ;
the second is an enclitic (554, 760), as will be seen from the accent of
the first, and is spelled ‘pot, as may be observed from the meter. Here

before that of <foreign xml:lang="greek">τραφίν</foreign>, although <foreign xml:lang="greek">τράφίν</foreign> here precedes lyevovro. This
is a permissible device, as it indicates priority of interest, instead of the
usual one of time. Compare Shakespere’s “I was bred and bom.”
The main idea is contained in the first expression, while the second is
added as an after-thought, for the sake of greater fullness and accuracy.

civilization to feel sure that the world is growing worse, that men have
degenerated from a garden-of-Eden stage, when all the world was bright
and happy, when no man did wrong, sickness and sin and sorrows were
not, and the race of men was much better physically as well as morally
than succeeding generations. Since that time the world has continued
to decline till it has reached its present deplorable state. Such ideas
flourish actively in an uncritical and credulous age, when men are perfectly
willing to believe of a former period that “there were giants in
the earth in those days; the same became mighty men, which'were of
old men of renown.” Thus Homer feels convinced that the warriors
whose doughty deeds he sings were far superior to the race of mortals of
his own time. For example, he says “ with his hand the son of Tydeus
seized a stone, a mighty weight, which not even two men could carry,
such as mortals now are, but even alone he waved it easily.” And again

it with ease.” And again: “ Hector snatched up a stone and lifted it,
which not even two of the best men of the people, such as men now are,
could pry from the ground upon a wagon with crowbars, but he easily
brandished it alone.” Furthermore, Homer’s characters, and those of
epic in genera], are divine, or greater than ordinary mortals.

using exactly the same expression of prohibition in addressing the two

Agamemnon, the second to Achilles.

278-279. Never has (any other) sceptre-hearing ling obtained honor equal
(to that of Agamemnon). That is, according to the Homeric tradition,
as placed in the mouth of Nestor, Agamemnon was the mightiest ruler
of his time; therefore Achilles should yield precedence to him. Nestor
emphasizes the divine right of Icings, who have obtained their authority
by grace of god, and as such are his representatives on earth. To oppose
one would be blasphemous; for they are the Lord’s own anointed.
“ And it came to pass afterward that David’s heart smote him because
he had cut off Saul’s skirt. And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid
that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord’s anointed, to
stretch forth my hand against him, seeing that he is the anointed of the
Lord.” “ David and Abishai came to the people by night; and behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster. Then said Abishai unto David, God hath delivered thine
enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore, let me smite him, I pray
thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him
a second time. And David said unto Abishai, Destroy him not; for
who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and be
guiltless ? ”

282. “Nay, it is 7, even Nestor, who entreat thee.” Nestor makes a
strong personal appeal to the king. The emphatic eytii (761) is further
stressed by being placed at the end of the verse, and by being followed
by ye.

283. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Νίστωρ</foreign> XitrtrtTCU <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀγαμί'μνονα μίθίμίναι χόλον ἀχιλλήι</foreign> (997).

284. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Άχαιοϊσιν</foreign> : 997, 999. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ιτολίμοιο</foreign> : 979,3. Nestor employs a figurative
expression in speaking of Achilles, of a type common to many
languages; thus in the psalmist: “ Jehovah is my defence; and my god
is the rock of my refuge.”

286. <foreign xml:lang="greek">κατὰ μοίραν</foreign> : fittingly.

287. 3S <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀνήρ</foreign> is said by Agamemnon with supreme contempt, as he
does not even deign to mention the hated name of his opponent: “ this
fellow.”

Agamemnon apparently agrees with Nestor’s contention, but will admit
no fault of his own, throwing all the blame on Achilles. He insists
further that his overlordship be formally recognized by the rebellious
spirit of Achilles (see vss. 54, 59 ff., etc.), but Achilles refuses. Agamemnon
is not altogether without justice on his side, as Achilles has done
much to call his authority in question and has set a bad precedent in
case there should be difficulty in the future.

it is superlatively ironical and sarcastic. If it merely means “ many a

in it.

298. <foreign xml:lang="greek">χ«ρτί:</foreign> 1005. — th : 760.

299. tu [ris, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τι</foreign> 769]: Achilles is having a hard struggle with his
pride. He is afraid that some one will call him a coward if he yields to
Agamemnon’s demand that he recognize his authority, and so he finally
decides that he would rather give up the girl, even though he does love
her (see note to vs. 348) than yield to Agamemnon’s wishes. He has
now come to the point of open rebellion against the king, and flatly
refuses to take any further orders from him or to recognize his authority,
as Agamemnon had insisted.

et'vtKa <foreign xml:lang="greek">κοΐρηβ</foreign> is said with supreme contempt. “ I would not fight with
my hands on account of a girl.” Achilles attempts to conceal his real
feelings, as he sees that he has no way of successfully opposing the king
and his forces. Before closing, however, he makes it quite plain that he
holds all the Greeks responsible for the wrong done him, because they
have not the courage to oppose Agamemnoh’s arrogance, and thus through
him they are taking back the prize they once gave.

300. ' poi: 999. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">«πι:</foreign> 973,1.

301. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τῶν</foreign> resumes the <foreign xml:lang="greek">των ἀλλων</foreign> of vs. 300, with added emphasis. —
cUkovtos Ipcto : 1111.

302. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ΐΓίίρησαι</foreign> is issued in the form of a challenge: “just try it!”
“ I dare you to try it.” In placing a higher value on liis other possessions
than on his prize, Achilles seems to have suffered an unexpected change
of heart, and whether it is a case of “ sour grapes ” or not, he seems suddenly
to have become converted to the idea that after all “a woman
is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.”

303. <foreign xml:lang="greek">δουρὶ</foreign> (ίμω).

297-303. These words of Achilles come pretty close to the ridiculous,
and doubtless provoked loud hoots and jeers from Agamemnon’s partisans.
The whole quarrel had been about the girl; and Achilles by this
statement throws his cause completely overboard and brings up another
subject having nothing to do with the question. Agamemnon had never
remotely intimated that he was considering anything of this kind.

first introduced by his patronymic, because he was such a well-known
figure of the legend that it was not necessary to be more specific. He
and Achilles were fast friends, and he stood by Achilles through all this
period of trial. It is only his death in battle which furnishes a motive
sufficiently powerful to induce Achilles to take a further part in the
fighting. His introduction at this point is very skillfully done, as it is
clearly indicated where he stands in relation to the hero.

313-314. The whole army had been made unclean by Agamemnon’s
guilt, as had happened to the army of Joshua because of Achan : so they
must be purified. Physical cleanness, acquired by washing, symbolized
ritualistic purity, just as the rite of baptism typifies the washing away
of the sinner’s guilt. To a mind lacking in poetic and creative imagination,
it might occur that we have here a real hint as to the cause of such
a plague, in a lack of proper sanitary measures and of bodily cleanliness
on the part of the Greeks. After they had given themselves a good
scouring, the plague ceased. In the same way, many of the “ laws of
Moses,” with their ritual of purification, rested ultimately upon a dimly
discerned sanitary basis. “ He that toucheth the dead body of any man
shall be unclean seven days; the same shall purify himself ” (with water
and ashes).

centre, while the two ends, the most dangerous positions, were held by
Achilles and Ajax, as the most redoubtable warriors of the whole army,

<p>334. Aios ayyikoi: officials in antiquity regularly obtained
their authority from on high, and were the earthly representatives of
divine power. As such they were to be respected and honored at all
times; “ for thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy
people.” “ And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it
is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.”

heralds, lest he might break out into open violence, hastens to set them
at ease and to let them know that they need not be afraid of him, for he
would not harm them.

337 ff. Achilles asks Patroclus to lead out the maiden and hand her
over to the heralds, evidently not having the heart to do it himself. As
we know from later developments, he had fallen in love with her.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">εϊο-ytWs:</foreign> Zeus-born. The kings of antiquity were regularly gods and
sons of gods. “Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my son; this
day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” Thus shortly before the introduction
of Christianity altars were set up in various parts of the Roman
empire upon which sacrifices were made to Augustus Caesar as a “ god

<p>348. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀκουσ’(α</foreign>) is a delicate touch of the poet, showing that
Briseis returned Achilles’ affection, and that Achilles is angry not
merely because of wounded honor. This adds to the pathos of the
situation. Later Achilles himself says, “But why must the Argives

; make war on the Trojans? Why hath the sou of Atreus gathered his
host and led them thither? Is it not for lovely-haired Helen’s sake?
Do then the sons of Atreus alone of mortal men love their wives?
Surely whatsoever man is good and sound of mind loveth his own and
clierisheth her, even as I too loved mine with all my heart, though but
the captive of my spear. But uow that he hath taken my prize of
honor from my arms and hath deceived me, let him not tempt me that
know him full well; he shall not prevail.” It is this true affection
between Achilles and Briseis which makes the present situation so inexpressibly
bitter for him. Homer does not waste words in farewell
scenes, and here he sums up the feelings of Briseis in a single adjective.

349. <foreign xml:lang="greek">δακρΐο-</foreign>as, 1081: by this simple description the hearer was made

[378

his feelings. He “ burst into tears,” partly perhaps from grief, but even
more in hot and helpless anger at the insults that had been heaped
upon him. Homer’s heroes are highly emotional, and are not ashamed
to give full expression to their feelings. They are no more dainty about
the shedding of tears than they are over the shedding of blood. Later,
■when the battle has been going against the Greeks, Homer says of Agamemnon,
“ The son of Atreus was stricken to the heart with sore grief,
and went about bidding the clear-voiced heralds summon every man by
name to the assembly. ... So they sat sorrowful in assembly, and
Agamemnon stood up weeping like unto a fountain of dark water that
from a beetling cliff poureth down its black stream; even so with
deep groaning he spake among the Argives.”

350. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίφ’</foreign> ( = ’em) : 1050, 1. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">όρόων:</foreign> an “ assimilated,” or “ distracted ”
form (= <foreign xml:lang="greek">δράων</foreign>), 915-948. It is eminently proper that Achilles should
be represented as looking out upon the deep; since the boundless sea
with its countless, never-resting waves, corresponds to the endless tumult
of his troubled soul.

351. <foreign xml:lang="greek">μητρί:</foreign> her name is Thetis, but is not yet mentioned, as it was
well known to the hearers of the bard. She had been wooed by Zeus
and Poseidon, but when Zeus learned that she was fated to bear a son
mightier than his father, he forced her against her will, goddess though
she was, to marry Peleus, by whom she bore Achilles. When Achilles
set out for the Trojan war, she packed his trunk with plenty of warm
woolen articles of wear, deserted her husband, and returned to her old
home in the sea, that she might be near her beloved son in whose
fortunes she took a passionate interest.

Xttpas <foreign xml:lang="greek">όρί-</foreign>yvis : when the ancients prayed they regularly stretched out
then- hands in the direction of the divinity whom they entreated. If
this were a god of heaven, they lifted up their hands toward the sky; if
a god of the sea, they stretched out their hands as Achilles does here;
if a god of the lower world, they might even sit down and beat upon
the ground to attract his attention.

352. It is a distinctly human touch that Achilles should turn to his
mother for consolation; for women are often inchned to be sympathetic
and to take the side of their childreu. Thus when Aphrodite gets her
hand scratched in battle by the spear of Diomedes, she shrieks aloud,
and hurries back to heaven, where she falls into her mother’s lap and
sobs out her grief. Her mother of course consoles her, and strokes the
hand which has been hurt, and it is all cured once more. In the same
way a modern mother might kiss her little child’s head which he
bumped when he fell down. On the other hand, Ares, the god of war,

<pb n="155"/>



who has been severely wounded in battle, but who is out of favor with
his mother, is stupid enough to carry his tale of woe to his father.
Homer says, “ swiftly he came to the gods’ dwelling, steep Olympus,
and sat beside Zeus, son of Cronus, with grief in his heart, and showed
the immortal blood flowing from the wound, and piteously spake to him
winged words. . . . Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at
him and said : ‘ Nay, tliou renegade, sit not beside me and whine.’ ”

352. <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ.ινυνθά8ιον:</foreign> Achilles had the choice of a long and inglorious
life, or one short and full of renown. He had chosen the latter, and
now that he has made this choice, his situation is one of deep pathos.
It is this certainty of an early death which casts its gloom over all the
rest of his days. He seems later to have become somewhat more reconciled
to this, and when he is entreated with piteous words by one of the
Trojans to spare his life, he says, “ Aye, friend, thou too must die : why
lamentest thou? Patroclus too is dead, who was better far than thou.
Seest thou not also what manner of man am I for might and goodliness?
Yet over me too hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or
eve or some noonday when my life too some man shall take in battle,
whether with spear he smite or arrow from the string.” The old Greeks
were so in love with life that death seemed clothed with more than
ordinary gloom. When Odysseus meets the soul of Achilles in Hades
he tries to console him by saying “ As for thee, Achilles, none other
than thou wast heretofore the most blessed of men, nor shall any be
hereafter. For of old, in the days of thy life, we Argives gave thee one
honor with the gods, and now thou art a great prince here among the
dead. Wherefore let not thy death be any grief to thee, Achilles.”
But Achilles replies, “Nay, speak not to me comfortably of death, O
great Odysseus. Rather would I live on ground as the hireling of
another, with a landless man who had no great livelihood, than to rule
over all that have gone down to death.”

353. <foreign xml:lang="greek">τιμήν:</foreign> emphatic by position, showing how keenly the old Greek
heroes thirsted for glory, and how bitterly they resented any affront to
their honor.

354. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ϋψιβρίμί'τηϊ:</foreign> thunder and lightning were ordinary accompaniments
of the gods of old. In fact, primitive man often thought that
thunder was the actual voice of his god, who thus roared, growled, and
muttered on high. In Hebrew, for example, the ordinary expression for
thunder is qol Jahweh, “the voice of Jehovah.” “Jehovah shall roar
from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall
mightily roar against his fold.” “And Jehovah shall roar from Zion,
and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth

<pb n="156"/>LESSON LIX

[379-380

shall shake.” “ Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the muttering
that goeth out of his mouth. He sendeth it forth under the whole
heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice
roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: God thundereth
marvelously with his voice.” “ And Jehovah thundered from heaven,
and the Most High uttered his voice. And he sent out arrows and scattered
them; lightning and discomfited them.” “ And it came to pass
on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings,
and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet
exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mount.”
Even in a later age the voice of a divinity might in some cases he mistaken
for thunder by the uninitiated : “ Then came there a voice from
heaven, saying, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people
therefore, that stood by and heard it, said that it thundered: others
said, An angel spake to him.”

what the trouble is, and although Achilles recognizes this, still it is quite
true to life to have her as his mother ask him what the trouble is,
and quite as true- to nature that Achilles should unburden his woes,
thereby relieving his feelings. It is good art also on the part of the poet
that this action so important for the subsequent development of the plot
should be emphasized as strongly as possible by being repeated, as it is
here.

on the pinnacle of the temple.”

Eetion seems to be mentioned here for the purpose of preparing the

pathetic figures of all literature.

Achilles had a share in the expedition and in procuring Chryseis for

all, serves to throw his selfishness and ingratitude into high relief.

388. The two spondees at the beginning of this verse give it an especially
heavy, halting effect. Some would see in this an attempt of the
poet in his verse to paint the feelings of Achilles in his choking anger
when he recalls this part of the situation. Achilles does not give an
absolutely truthful account of matters. Naturally he does not emphasize
his own part wherein he might be blamed, in calling the assembly
without the sanction of the king, or even without consulting him, and
then bluntly coming forward with a public proposal that the expedition
be given up, and later instigating the seer to make his declaration, which
was the immediate cause of Agamemnon’s violent outburst.

commonly have clouds at their command, either to bring rain, or often

sing praise upon the harp to our God: who covereth the heaven with
clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth.” “And Jehovah went before
them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way; and by night in.
a pillar of fire to give them light.” “And the glory of Jehovah abode
upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh
day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.”

400. These three divinities were now on the side of the Greeks,
which would give added weight to the prayer of Thetis for help to the
Trojans.

Observe the rhyme at the end of this verse, with the verse preceding.

Thetis is the “mater dolorosa” of Homer, the only divinity in the
poems who suffers human woe. Her motherly affection for her only
son, who is destined to an early death, has cast its shadow over her
whole existence.

423-4. This is to explain why his request cannot be granted immediately.
It also motivates the inactivity of Achilles for this period, thus
throwing into strong relief his abiding anger. The gods were always
ready to enjoy a good dinner. Here there is a more or less conscious
contrast between tlieir happy, care-free existence and that of the heroes
of the Iliad, which was so full of bitter sorrow. This verse seems to be
in contradiction with the preceding account, according to which Apollo
is at hand, shooting his arrows; Hera is in heaven, from which she
sends Athena, who returns thither to the other divinities. But the poet
could count on the indulgence of his hearers not to be hypercritical in
such matters. His desire to produce striking dramatic effects, and to
motivate various actions, sometimes leads him into such slight inconsistencies,
and the same can be said of many another great author.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">ἈΙΘιοπήαϊ:</foreign> it is a characteristic of the earlier civilizations and was

a purer and more moral form than tlieir later and more degenerate
descendants, who have been corrupted by their culture and lost their
original simplicity» Thus Kousseau {The Inequality of Man) : “Men
are bad; my own sad experience furnishes the proof; yet man is naturally
good, as I think I have shown. What then can so have degraded
him except the changes in his condition, the progress he has made, and
the knowledge he has acquired ? ” In another place {Emile) he says:
“ Coming from the hand of the Author of all things, everything is good;
in the hands of man everything degenerates. Man obliges one soil to
nourish the productions of another, one tree to bear the fruits of
another; he mingles and confounds climates, elements, seasons; he
mutilates his dog, his horse, his slave. He overturns everything, disfigures
everything; he loves deformity, monsters; he desires that nothing
should be as nature made it, not even man himself. To please him,
man must be broken in like a horse; man must be adapted to Man’s
own fashion, like a tree in his garden.” Cf. the note on vs. 272, § 355.

These verses give the final touches to the structure which furnishes a
reasonable motive for Achilles to remain inactive instead of returning
home as he had threatened (vs. 169).

conservatism, of a distinctly primitive practice. ‘At an early day, before
men knew how to grind their grain, they offered it whole to their gods.
As civilization advanced, religious ceremonies, with their static tendency,
remained practically unchanged, and whole barleycorns were still offered
to their gods. In the same way the feast of unleavened bread among
the old Hebrews was probably a survival of a primitive practice, inherited
from a stage when they had not yet learned the use of leaven.

mixed them in the proportion of three
parts of wine to two of water; but the
poet Hesiod recommends one part of wine
to three of water. The later Greeks, who
lacked the stern simplicity of the rustic poet,
claimed that this would be more suitable as
a drink for fishes than for men.

beginning of their religious ceremony, which was performed in this case
by each of those present pouring a few drops of wine from his cup as a
libation before the drinking began. The libation corresponded to the
“ drink offerings”pi the Old Testament. “In the holy place shalt thou
cause the strong;wine to be poured unto Jehovah for a drink offering.”
The worshippers thus shared their food and drink (communion) with
their god. According to primitive ideas, those who eat of the same loaf
an4 drink of the same cup become of the same flesh and blood when the

<pb n="175"/>

food is assimilated into their bodies. This would thus establish and
maintain the strongest possible bond between the divinity and his
worshippers. “ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion
of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion
of the body of Christ? seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one
body; for we all partake of the one bread.” “ But I say that the things
which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God : and
I would not that ye should have communion with devils.”

472. <foreign xml:lang="greek">μολπή</foreign> : 1005, with song and dance. Singing has always been
looked upon as a suitable form of expression for pleasing a divinity.
Dancing also was long considered a form of religious exercise, and is
still found as such among many savag’e tribes. “ Let the children of
Zion be joyful in their king. Let them praise his name in the dance:
let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp.” “ And
David danced before Jehovah with all his might.”

words: “ Te Deum laudamus.”

omnipotent, etc. Olympus was so high that its top reached above the
clouds to heaven, where in the bright and sunny sky were the mansions
of the' gods. Heaven and Olympus seem to be used here, as elsewhere
in Homer, synonymously, without any very consistent picture in the
mind of the poet. Apparently the earlier belief in a physical Mount
Olympus as the abode of the gods was passing through a stage in which
it was rapidly becoming idealized, following pretty much the same
course as the Christian belief in a heaven and a hell, which were once
thought of as very real places.

absolutely essential for the following scene with Thetis, since Hera

<pb n="179"/>

would never have allowed it to take place, nor would Thetis have been
foolish enough to have attempted it in her presence. Furthermore, as

on the part of Thetis, “ you are so brave,” tut delicious humor on
the part of the poet, who knows that Zeus is afraid, and that nothing
else is holding him back.

To get the full benefit of this scene, it. must be understood that
although Thetis addresses Zeus as <foreign xml:lang="greek">πάτερ</foreign> (vs. 503), this is merely an honorary
title, to indicate his majesty and superior power among all the gods
and men. As a matter of fact, Thetis was an old flame of Zeus. She
must he thought of as eternally young and surpassingly beautiful.

<pb n="181"/>


She sets about her task with consummate skill and tact. She does not dwell on the fact that Zeus was deeply indebted to her (vs. 394 ff.), but passes this over lightly with an el irore (vs. 503). Her realization of the masculine weaknesses, and her ability to turn them to her own account, are good, as is best seen by her choice of epithets in addressing Zeus. First of all, as we have seen, he is warep, as supreme ruler and arbiter of the fates of all. In 508 she addresses him as firjTUTa, and later she says ov toi Ijti Seen. The modern equivalents would be "you are so wise . . . you are so brave." And since he is so wise and so brave, he would do anything for her if he loved her. 515-516 is practically a challenge : " Don't do it if you don't want to, and then I shall know that you don't care for me." She probably used a piteously tearful voice for this last plea, and of course there is nothing left for Zeus but unconditional surrender.

It is a particularly fine touch of the poet where he represents Zeus as sitting for a long time in contemplative silence (vs. 512), while Thetis prattles on, and in vs. 515 where she says, " You are not afraid of any thing." As a matter of fact, it is fear and nothing else which is troubling the father of gods and men. He is afraid of his own wife, and what she will say when she finds out. It would be beside the question to ask whether Thetis knew this in vs. 515, since she is consciously flattering Zeus, and need not be held to a strict accountability for absolute truthfulness.

<p>517. Zeus was greatly vexed, not at Thetis, but at the situation at home, and the inevitable storm when Hera finds out. He is evi dently in despair ; for he wishes to grant the request of Thetis, but is afraid of what Hera will say. — vc\ifyp£ra: see the note on vs. 397, § 386.

519. "H(m : 1007. — eitita-mv : 1005. Hera's name occupies the most important position in the verse, and in the word order, as again in vs. 523. Zeus in his anxious fear avoids mentioning her name as long as possible. She is evidently uppermost in his thoughts, even if she is not in his affections.

520. Kal auras : even as it is (without any further provocation). — iv aBavdrouri Seoio-iv : it adds greatly to the trials of Zeus that Hera was accustomed to reproach him in public, " among the other immortal gods," instead of reserving her admonitions for the more suitable privacy of the home.

521. uc : 971. — u.dXT| : 1005 (1009). — Tprcriv : 996.

The later tradition, with true insight into feminine psychology, was firmly convinced that Hera was so vindictive against the Trojans because at a contest of beauty, Paris was not willing to tell a lie and give her the prize, instead of to Aphrodite, her rival, who was surpass ingly beautiful and hence most cordially hated by her. Aphrodite, to

183




<pb/>

reward Paris for showing such good -judgment, gave him Helen, the most
beautiful woman in the world, to be his wife. But as Helen was already
married to Menelaus, her elopement with Paris to Troy brou ght on the
Trojan War, undertaken by the Greeks for the purpose of bringing her
home.

The abject terror of the father of gods and men, who raises his voice
almost to a whimper, as he tells how he is imposed upon at home, is
intended by the poet to produce a comic effect, and the remainder of the
first book of the Iliad is not merely comical but ludicrous at times.
This is carefully worked out by the poet, not merely as furnishing a
foil to his heroes, but for the purpose of providing a rest for his hearers and
a highly acceptable variety after the tensely tragical scenes of the preceding.
This whole passage, with the differences in tone of voice, gesture, and
manner, would offer especial opportunities to the bard in reciting his verses.

It seems hardly chivalrous of Zeus to drag out the skeleton from the
family closetforthe inspection of Thetis, but he must remove the suspicion,
half expressed by her in vs. 516, that he does not care for her. Throughout
this whole scene he treats Thetis as though she were an innocent
little girl, whom he is anxious to please, even at the expense of his own
discomfort. So he says in his kindest tones: “You hurry along back
home, and I will attend to all this. Only make sure that Hera doesn’t
see you.” It would have created a most disagreeable scene if Hera had
caught her.

527. <foreign xml:lang="greek">κατανεύσω</foreign> : aorist subjunctive. It is interesting to observe that
the nod of Zeus establishes his word as truthful and irrevocable,
whereas he plainly intimates that any mere promise on his part might be
deceitful and might be broken at any time, if it so pleased him. This
idea may go back to the practice which the images of the gods sometimes
had of nodding a confirmation to some of the prayers offered in the temples.

size, and reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
It was a work of such marvelous art that it was considered a misfortune
to die without having seen it. The calm majesty of these verses is in
marked contrast to the preceding anxious fear of Hera, just displayed
by the father of gods and men, which gives almost a grotesque effect.
It may be that the poet intended something of the kind in making
Olympus tremble at his nod, as on another occasion Hera makes Olympus
tremble by bouncing angrily about on her throne. The presence or
movements of divinities commonly made the earth and mountains trem-

footsteps, the mountains trembled, and the forests, beneath the immortal
footsteps of the god as he moved. “And Mount Sinai was altogether
on a smoke, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire: and the smoke
thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked
greatly.” “Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou
marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
dropped, the clouds also dropped water. The mountains quaked at the
presence of Jehovah.” “Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations

having to be told, she recognizes the situation. Perhaps Zeus
showed his guilt in his countenance, or else he may have looked more
fearful than usual. Of course she loses no time in giving him a “piece
of her mind,” and turns loose all her pent-up fury. In addition to forming
a pleasing variety, this scene is employed by the poet to make his
hearers more familiar with the attitude of the other divinities toward
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">βονλη</foreign> of Zeus (vs. 5), upon which the action of the whole poem
turns.

Agamemnon in Hades, who had a particularly hard time of it with his

Odysseus: “ Wherefore, do thou too never be soft even to thy wife, neither
show her all the counsel that thou knowest, but a part declare and let a

544. The conception of a god as a father is a common one, and well
known to most Christians from the opening words of the “ Pater Noster.”

545. Zeus begins in a grandiose style, and tells Hera pompously (the
spondaic ending of vs. 548 helps to give this effect) that his plans are
too deep for her understanding, seeing that she is only a woman.
Whenever he wants her to know anything he will tell her, so far as it
may be proper for her to hear. And further, just think! he will tell
her the very first, before anybody else. She must keep quiet now, and
stop prying into his private affairs. All this serves merely to confirm
her suspicions and opens the way for a more direct attack. The whole
attitude of Zeus toward Hera is pretty much the same as that which
furnishes the theme of Ibsen’s “ The Doll’s House.”

<p>552. Not a question, but an indignant exclamation. Ilera
now plays one trump after another. She shows a complete knowledge
of the situation, even in its details. It adds to the comedy that she is
much brighter than Zeus, whose pompous loftiness takes on a touch of
the absurd.

553. She throws back at Zeus his own words (άρομαι, <foreign xml:lang="greek">μεταλλάω</foreign>) in
an indignant denial of having been too inquisitive heretofore. On the
other hand, she has never before this (πάρος) inquired into his private
affairs, “but now (jvCv) this is too much for a loving and faithful wife
like me to endure.”

561. <foreign xml:lang="greek">δαιμονίη:</foreign> “thou fool.” — ouo.1 echoes the oiu> of vs. 558. Hera
there says, “I imagine,” to which Zeus replies, “Yes, you are always
imagining.” If llera has only made a shrewd guess, the towering rage
into -which Zeus falls at being so neatly caught would be the best possible
confirmation of her suspicions. — oihi rt <foreign xml:lang="greek">λήθω</foreign> : i.e. “You are always
spying on me.”

562. <foreign xml:lang="greek">αϊτό θϋμοΰ:</foreign> farther from my heart, i.e. you will lose my affec-

tions.— <foreign xml:lang="greek">π-ρήξαι:</foreign> in this connection it is interesting to observe how
well the poet knew human life ; for later Hera does succeed in outwitting
Zeus and does accomplish (πρηζαι) just what she had in mind here,
which Zeus is compelled in his discomfiture to acknowledge: “ Thou
hast accomplished it at last, O Hera, ox-eyed queen, thou hast aroused
Achilles fleet of foot.” ✓

564. “ Granted that this is true ” (which I do not). Zeus cannot
bring himself to make a clean breast of it. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">έμοὶ φίλον:</foreign> autocratic and
arbitrary: car tel est noire Ion plahir. Such is my good pleasure, reason
enough for the likes of you ; cf. Shakespeare, Jul. Cues., “ Decius, go tell
them (the senators) Caesar will not come.” “ Most mighty Caesar, let
me know some cause, lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.” “ The
cause is in my will, I will not come, that is enough to satisfy the senate.”

565. <foreign xml:lang="greek">άκίουο-α</foreign> : translate by another imperative, “ But shut up and sit
down.<foreign xml:lang="greek">”—μυθω:</foreign> 996. Zeus has lost completely in the argument, which
makes him very angry, so he now turns to threats of the direst violence.
These are not merely empty words either, as we know from another
occasion, when he tauntingly reminds Hera that he had once hung her
up with her hands tied together and an anvil bound to either foot. On
that occasion he threatened to horsewhip her severely. Like patient
Job, he finds his own wife too much to endure.

567. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίφίίω</foreign> must be understood of blow's as violent as Zeus had the
power to deliver them. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίόνθ’</foreign> (ιόντα) (pie).

This method of silencing Hera, contrary to ordinary human experience
in such matters, proves effective. It is necessary for the poetic
■ economy that she be stopped, so that there may be further development
in the action of the poem. Besides she is bright enough to sec that the
best method of having her way is by apparent submission.

Hephaestus essays the role of mediator, as Nestor did between Agamemnon
and Achilles, but with infinitely better success. He is evidently
much worried that they two should create such a disturbance
over such insignificant creatures as mortals. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ινεκα. θνητῶν</foreign> is said with
the utmost contempt, as being au unworthy cause for such wrangling.
Thus, on another occasion, when Poseidon challenges Apollo to a combat,
because of their having taken different sides in the Trojau war, Apollo
loftily replies, “ Shaker of the earth, thou wouldst consider me of unsound
mind if I should fight against thee for the sake of pitiful mortals, who
like unto leaves now live a glowing life, consuming the fruit of the
earth, and now again waste away in death.” On another occasion· the
poet says : “ This is the lot the gods have spun for miserable men, that
they should live in pain : yet themselves are sorrowless.”

575. Scutos : 979, 3. Here we catch a glimpse of the nature of tlie
gods, and of Hephaestus in particular. “ For shame, that you should
raise such a disturbance among the gods over mortals that you run the
risk of spoiling our dinner! ” The prospect of losing a good dinner
ought to be enough to bring the gods to terms.

taken literally, as throwing everything into confusion, as by breaking
up the furniture, overturning the table though loaded with food and
drink, and throwing all the gods out of the house, after having laid
violent hands, or feet, upon them.

580. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίθέλησιν</foreign> : 1135. — 580-581 : a good example of the figure known
as aposiopesis, i.e., instead of completing his sentence, the god breaks off
abruptly, and leaves to the imagination, as being beyond the power of
adequate expression in words, just what Zeus might do to them all, if
he should take the notion. It may be that Hephaestus is afraid to say
what will happen, for fear that a mere “absit omen” spoken thereafter
may not be sufficient to keep Zeus from doing this, and he fears to put
such an idea into the head of his still scowling, muttering father.

Evidently Zeus enjoyed throwing the gods out of heaven, to vent his
rage when angry, as he boasts of this on another occasion: “ 0 Hera,
hard to deal with. Nay but yet I know not whether thou mayest not
be the first to reap the fruits of thy cruel treason, and I beat thee with
stripes. Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high,
and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands I fastened
a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang
in the clear air and in the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high
Olympus, but they could not come round and loose thee. Nay, whomsoever
I might catch, I would clutch, and hurl from the threshold, to
come fainting to the earth.” The poet tells us that on another occasion,
“ But ZeuS, when he awakened, was wrathful, aud dashed the gods
about his mansion.” He was once deceived by the goddess of folly,

Atιέ. Thereupon “ he seized At6 by her bright-haired head in the anger
of his soul, and sware a mighty oath that never again to Olympus and
the starry heaven should Atd come, who blindeth all alike. He said,
and whirling her in his hand flung her from the starry heaven, and
quickly she arrived among the works of men.”

We need not demand of our poet absolute consistency in the treatment
of various features of his theme; and it would be idle to ask how
a god could fall to earth, if thrown out of heaven, when we see them
making daily trips from heaven to earth and return, through the air,
passing from one to the other in a moment, or very quickly, and without
any external assistance. This conception of the fall of Hephaestus,

From a vase painting by Duris

so crudely anthropomorphic, is matched by the Christian legend of
Satan having been thrown out of heaven, as developed in Milton’s
Paradise Lost. The poet is a little confused also in his topography here,
for if the seat of the gods is on the top of Mount Olympus, it would not
be possible for Hephaestus to occupy much time in falling to the earth.

Charlie Chaplin) that all of them laugh most uproariously.

psychologically; as the situation has been so exceptionally tense that

to give vent to their pent-up feelings in this undignified fashion.

<div type="textpart" n="455">
<p>The first book of the Iliad, after its grim and gloomy beginning
! amidst the tragedy of earthly life and its unending sorrows, closes amid
-the laughter of the care-free blessed gods, feasting happily on Olympus,
■ “ where, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast forever.
Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow
come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and
the white light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all
their days.” This alternate play of light and shade, of laughter and
of tears, of stern, dignified men, and frivolous, lighthearted gods, who
serve as their foil, is worked out by the poet with remarkable artistic
feeling and delicacy of touch. The scene on Olympus as contrasted
with the earlier action may best be compared to a satyr play, a kind of
burlesque show, which was regularly performed in ancient Athens at
the close of a series of tragedies, and for the same purpose, to relieve
the minds of the audience. ->

With surpassing art the poet has woven into the action and the
narrative of this book the most important characters, both human and
divine, of the entire poem.

“No book of Homer is so full of dramatic groups and situations as
this : Apollo striding with his bow and ringing quiver; Thetis caressing
the grieving and angry Achilles; Thetis before Zeus, clasping· bis knees
and extending her right hand toward his chin; Zeus with his dark
brows and ambrosial locks nodding a confirmation to his promise;
Chryses with his filleted scepter and his gifts, before the two sons cf
Atreus; Odysseus at the altar of Apollo with the maiden whom he is
restoring to her aged father, — with his companions and the hecatomb ;
Achilles in his rage drawing his sword from its sheath, calmed by
Athena, who takes him by his long locks, — with Agamemnon before
him and the other chiefs around him; the heralds of Agamemnon at
the tent of Achilles, as Patroclus leads forth the fair Briseis; Zeus and
Hera on Olympus, with Hephaestus playing the part of Hebd; the
assembly of the gods, Apollo playing the lyre, and the singing muses.”

<div type="textpart"><head>Introduction to Attic Greek</head>

<div type="textpart" n="456">
<p>Dialects. — The Greek language was divided into a number
of dialects, the most important groups of which were the
Aeolic, Ionic (Ionic-Attic), and Doric.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" n="457">
<p>Very closely related to Ionic is Attic, and both are usually
grouped together as Ionic-Attic. In the great mass of their forms
they are fundamentally alike, and differ
only in minor details.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="458">
<p>The Homeric poems are composed
in what is known as the Homeric dialect,
a mixture of Aeolic and Ionic, the bulk of
the forms being Ionic (620).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="459">
<p>Contraction. — Attic carries the
contraction of vowels to a further extent
than does any other of the Greek dialects,
two or more vowels coming together and
admitting of contraction practically never
remaining uncontracted.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="460">
<p>Hence one of the most important
things for the student to do in passing
from Homeric to Attic Greek is to memorize
thoroughly the table of contractions
(584-585).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="461">
<p>In general vowels are contracted
in Attic as in Homer (584-585), the only
exceptions being that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε</foreign> + <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε</foreign> + <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ</foreign>
in Attic instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek">εὐ</foreign> in Homer.

<p>Treatment of ᾱ in Attic. — After e, i, p, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign> of Homer,

<foreign xml:lang="greek">τα προς τον πόλεμον</foreign> the things (needful) for the war.

<p>7) The neuter article is prefixed to any word or part of speech
when considered merely as an expression, as to <foreign xml:lang="greek">λε'γει</foreign> the word
“ <foreign xml:lang="greek">λεγει,”</foreign> to yviodi <foreign xml:lang="greek">σεαντόν</foreign> the (saying) “ know thyself”</p>

<p>8) The neuter article in the singular, all cases, is used with the
infinitive (articular infinitive), when emphasizing the substantive
character of the infinitive. In this usage it is commonly translated
by the English verbal noun in -ing, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">το καλώ·: μάχεσθαι
(</foreign>the act of) fighting bravely, to fight bravely, to ypafiuv (nom.)
writing, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τον γράφειν</foreign> of writing, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τω γράφειν</foreign> to, or for writing, <foreign xml:lang="greek">το
γράφειν</foreign> (acc.) icriting. Note. — The article is always thus used
with the infinitive when the infinitive is construed with a
preposition.</p></div>

<p>Verbal adjectives. — In addition to verbal adjectives in
-T09, as found in Homer and denoting possibility, or merely as
the equivalent of the perfect passive participle, Attic Greek has
a verbal adjective in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-τίο:</foreign>, similarly formed, and used with dpi
(often omitted), expressing necessity or duty, and admitting of
two constructions :</p>

<p>1) Personal (passive) construction. Only verbal nouns from
transitive verbs can be thus employed, the verbal agreeing in
gender and number with the subject. The agent is in the dative,
as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ύφελητέὰ σοι</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">πάλι: Ιστὶ</foreign> the state must be benefited by you, ov
<foreign xml:lang="greek">7τρό</foreign> ye <foreign xml:lang="greek">τη: αλήθεια.·: τιμητέο: ἀνηρ</foreign> ci man must not be honored before
the truth.</p>

<p>2) Impersonal (active) construction. In this construction,
which is more frequent, the verbal is active in meaning and
stands in the neuter nominative, usually singular, while its object
is in the case which the finite verb would govern. The agent, if
expressed, is usually in the dative, but is sometimes in the
accusative as if dependent upon <foreign xml:lang="greek">δε?</foreign>, which has a meaning similar
to that contained in these verbals, one must. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίσκψεον σοι
την αρετήν</foreign> you must Cultivate virtue, tovs <foreign xml:lang="greek">φίλον: ινεργετητεον</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">την
πόλιν ώφελητεον</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">των βοσκημάτων ετημελητεον</foreign> One must do favors for
one’s friends, benefit one’s state, and care for one’s cattle, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τον
βουλόμενον ἐνδαίμονα είναι σωφροσύνην διωκτεον καὶ ἀσκητεον</foreign> he who
desires to be happy must pursue and cultivate temperance.

<p>ἀν in Attic. — Attic, which does not employ k?(v), has the
following unhomeric uses of av:</p>

worth a great deal to be wealthy if joy were associated with it.</p>

<p>2) With past tenses it takes the place of the iteratives in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-σκον,</foreign>
which are not found in Attic Greek, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίτρε-πεν ἀν</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">τρέπεσκεν,
ετρεψεν ἀν</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">τρέψασκ€ν.</foreign></p>

<p>3) The subjunctive with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀν</foreign> is found in general statements
which are valid also for the future, where English employs the
indicative present, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">μαινόμίθα πάντα ό-ότ' ἀν ἀργιζωμεθα</foreign>, tve are all

<p>Contraction. —When one vowel follows another vowel in
the same word, contraction sometimes (but not usually) takes
place. When vowels are thus contracted, the following are the
rules:</p>

<p>1) Vowels which regularly form diphthongs do so, as a 4-1 = at,
o 4- i = oi, etc.

Note.—Observe that the long vowels ἀ, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, when followed by i
regularly form the improper diphthongs a, y, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign> (505).</p>

<p>2) Two like sounds unite in the common long sound, that is,
two a-sounds (a), two e-sounds (e, <foreign xml:lang="greek">η</foreign>), two i-sounds (i), two

<pb n="218"/>ELISION, CONTRACTION, SYNIZESIS [585-586

o-sounds (ο, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>), or two u-sounds (υ), unite to form the common
long (ά, ἡ, l, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, ΰ) sounds, except ee becomes a, and oo becomes <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ.</foreign></p>

<p>3) An o-sound absorbs an abound or an e-sound and becomes
long <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> (ω), except to gives tv, while ot becomes ov.</p>

<p>4) If an abound comes together with an e-sound, the one which
comes first absorbs the other and becomes long (α, <foreign xml:lang="greek">-η</foreign>).</p>

<p>5) A vowel coming before a diphthong beginning with the
same vowel may be, absorbed, and t may be absorbed before oi.
In other cases a vowel before a diphthong may be contracted
with the first vowel of the diphthong, a following iota becoming
iota subscript (505), and a following <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign> disappearing.</p>

<p>Sonant Consonants. — In an earlier stage of the language,
the liquids (λ, p) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign>, v of the nasals were often vocalic
(sonant) ; that is, they were used as vowels in certain combinations.
In this case they are ordinarily written with a small circle

<div type="textpart" n="598">
<p>In G-reek as we know the language:</p>

masculine and feminine, of the third declension, for an earlier -v

THE PARTHENON

After serving as a temple for about nine centuries, the Parthenon was turned into a Christian
church, and later into a Mohammedan mosque. In 1687 a.d. the Venetians bombarded Athens
and sent a shell into the center of the building, which the Turks had used as a powder magazine.
The result was an explosion that threw down the side walls and many of the columns.
<pb/>TRANSLITERATION, INFLECTION [625-633</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="625">
<p>Greek proper names are transliterated according to the
foregoing rules. They are put into the nominative (639), and
are pronounced by ignoring the Greek accent and by accenting
the penult (543) of the word if it is long (522) in Greek, otherwise
the antepenult ( 543), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀητώ</foreign> Lito, <foreign xml:lang="greek">"Ολυμπος</foreign> Olympus.

II. MORPHOLOGY
INFLECTION</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="626">
<p>Inflection, including declension (nouns, adjectives, pronouns),
comparison (adjectives, adverbs), and conjugation, is the
fusion of a so-called stem (630), and certain elements which express
relationship to other words.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="627">
<p>A root is the essential part of a word which remains after
it has been analyzed into its various parts, and all prefixes, suffixes,
and formative elements have been removed.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="628">
<p>A stem often has more than one form, its different forms
usually standing in ablaut (593-595) relation to each other. It
is ordinarily derived from a root, by the addition of various
formative elements, prefixes, and suffixes.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="629">
<p>Some roots are also stems, and are combined directly
with inflectional elements.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="630">
<p>An inflected word is in general made up of two parts:</p>

<p>1) The fundamental part, or stem.</p>

<p>2) The inflectional element (usually an ending, commonly called a
suffix ; sometimes a prefix, as in the case of the augment, <ref>830</ref>), which
combines with the stem to form case, number, tense, person, etc.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="631">
<p>The last letter of the stem is called the stem characteristic,
and from this last letter stems are classified as vowel stems, mute
(509) stems, liquid (516) stems, etc.

DECLENSION

Nouns</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="632">
<p>Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="633">
<p>Number. — There are three numbers in Greek, the singular
denoting one, the dual denoting two (usually referring to a pair of

<pb n="227"/>

objects closely associated, or belonging together by nature and
forming a closely related, unified group, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">χεῖρε</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὀφθαλμώ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἵππω</foreign> the
two hands, eyes, horses. Compare yoke, team, pair in English),
and the plural denoting more than two.

Note. — The plural is often used interchangeably with the dual to
denote only two.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="634">
<p>Gender. — There are three genders, the masculine,
feminine, and neuter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="635">
<p>The gender must usually he learned by observation, hut
in general:</p>

<p>1) The names of males are masculine.</p>

<p>2) The names of females are feminine.</p>

<p>3) The names of rivers, winds, and months are usually masculine.</p>

<p>4) The names of countries, towns, trees, and islands are usually

feminine.</p>

<p>5) Most nouns denoting qualities and conditions are feminine.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="636">
<p>A few nouns are used either as masculine or feminine, as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">παῖς</foreign> child, which may be of either gender, and may mean either
hoy or girl, as may be required by occasion. Such words are said
to be of common gender.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="637">
<p>The demonstrative (often relative, or personal) pronoun
most extensively used in the Homeric poems is <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁ</foreign>, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign>, the first
form being masculine, the second feminine, and the third neuter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="638">
<p>The form of the noun which appears in the vocabulary is
the nominative singular, unless otherwise indicated. This is followed
by the ending of the genitive singular<note>grc:I think we should change this and show the whole form -- more space but more explicit</note>, which denotes to
which declension the noun belongs. After the ending of the genitive
singular is placed the appropriate form of this,, pronoun, to
indicate the gender. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεός</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεοῦ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁ</foreign> god is second declension
masculine; <foreign xml:lang="greek">βουλἠ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">βουλῆς</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign> wish, will, plan is first declension feminine,
and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄλγος</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄλγεος</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign> pain, woe is third declension neuter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="639">
<p>Cases. — There are five cases in Greek, the nominative,
genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative, together with remnants
of three lost cases, the locative, instrumental, and ablative (657).

<pb n="228"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="640">
<p>All these cases except the nominative and vocative are
called oblique cases.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="641">
<p>Accent of Nouns. — The accent of a noun usually remains
in all the forms on the same syllable as in the nominative singular,
or at least as near that syllable as the general rules of accent will
allow. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἥρως</foreign> (nominative singular), but <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡρώων</foreign> of heroes
(genitive plural). See 544 ff.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="642">
<p>Words monosyllabic in the nominative singular, when
becoming dissyllabic by declension, regularly have the accent on
the final syllable in all the dissyllabic forms of the genitive and
dative of all numbers, but keep the accent on the first syllable in
all other cases.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="643">
<p>An accented ultima in general takes the acute, but in the
genitive and dative of all numbers a long ultima, if accented,
takes the circumflex, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ψύχη</foreign> soul (nom. sing.), but <foreign xml:lang="greek">ψνχῆς</foreign> of a soul
(gen. sing.), <foreign xml:lang="greek">ψνχῃ</foreign> to, for a soul (dat. sing.), etc.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="644">
<p>Declensions. —Nouns are declined in two general ways:</p>

<p>1) The vowel declension, for stems (628) ending in the open
vowels, ᾱ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο.</foreign></p>

<p>2) The consonant declension, for stem's ending in a consonant,
or the closed vowels, i, v.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="645">
<p>The vowel declension has two forms, according as the
noun stem ends in d or o. Hence we have:</p>

<p>1) The <foreign xml:lang="greek">α</foreign> declension, commonly called the first declension;</p>

<p>2) The <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> declension, commonly called the second declension.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="646">
<p>The consonant declension, for stems ending in a closed
vowel (ι, <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign>, which were at times semi-consonantal) or a consonant,
is commonly called the third declension.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="647">
<p>Words of the first declension have stems ending in ᾱ,
which either becomes shortened in the nominative singular to ᾰ,
or else becomes <foreign xml:lang="greek">η</foreign> (621), except in the one word <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεἀ</foreign> goddess, and a
very few proper names. Nouns of the first declension are either
masculine or feminine.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="648">
<p>Case Endings. — To form the various cases, numbers, and
genders, the following case endings were fused with the stems
of substantives and adjectives :

<div type="textpart" n="681">
<p>There are many forms of the nominative of third declension
nouns, which must be learned partly by practice, but in general
:</p>

<p>1) Masculine and feminine stems, except those ending in v, p,
and <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign>, add <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> to the stem and make the usual euphonic changes</p>

<p>2) Masculine and feminine stems ending in p, <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> and most of
those ending in v make no change except to lengthen the last
vowel if it is short.</p>

<p>3) Stems ending in v(t) either make no change except to
lengthen the last vowel if it is short, dropping final <foreign xml:lang="greek">τ</foreign> wherever
it occurs, or else they add <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> to the stem and make the usual
euphonic changes (613), loss of v(t) and lengthening of the preceding
vowel. Thus the stems : <foreign xml:lang="greek">δαιρ,ον-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">θϊν-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ρ,ελαν-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">γεροντ-</foreign> give the

old man, respectively.</p>

Greek verbs fall into two main classes :</p>

<p>1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">-ω</foreign> verbs, i.e. those ending in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-ω</foreign> in the first person singular,

present active indicative, sometimes called athematic verbs (797).</p>

<div type="textpart" n="796">
<p>The thematic verbs are so named because in a majority

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ν</foreign>, or in the optative mode, otherwise <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε</foreign>), which is
called the thematic vowel. Thus, <foreign xml:lang="greek">λυε/ο-</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">λύω</foreign>) is called the theme,
to which the personal endings (819-821) are attached.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="797">
<p>Athematic verbs do not have this connecting vowel, but the
personal endings are attached directly to the stem of the verb.</p>

<foreign xml:lang="greek">-σ(σ)ε/ο</foreign> to the verb stem, followed by the personal endings of
the primary tenses.

<div type="textpart" n="863">
<p>Second Tenses. — Many verbs have what are called second
tenses, as second aorists (active, middle, and passive), and second
perfects and pluperfects (active). These second tenses are irregular
in formation, and are thus named to distinguish them from
the more common, regularly formed tenses, which are called first
tenses.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="864">
<p>The meaning of these second tenses ordinarily corresponds
to that of the first tenses, except in the comparatively few cases
when a verb has both forms. Then the first and second tenses
may differ slightly in meaning, usually by the first being transitive
(sometimes causative), the second intransitive, Compare the
Americanism shine, shined, shined, used transitively, as in the
expression “ he shined my shoes,” with the more common forms
of the verb, shine, shone, shone, used intransitively, as “ the sun
shone.” “ Shined ” may be compared in form and meaning to a
first aorist, while “ shone ” would correspond in form and meaning
to a second aorist. Thus in Greek, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβην</foreign> (2d aor.) signifies
I went, walked (intransitive), while <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβησα</foreign> (1st aor.) signifies I
caused to go, walked (transitive), as in English I walked my horse
(ἔβησα <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἵππον</foreign>) i.e. I caused my horse to walk.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="865">
<p>Second aorists are formed in various ways :</p>

<p>1) A common method is for them to have the secondary (816)
endings, following the thematic vowel <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε/ο</foreign>, thus being conjugated
like the imperfect, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔχω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἕξω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔσχον</foreign> to have, where <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔσχον</foreign> the
second aorist is conjugated like <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλυον</foreign>, the imperfect of <foreign xml:lang="greek">λὐω</foreign> to loose.</p>

<p>2) Many have the secondary endings attached directly to the
tense stem, and thus are conjugated like the aorist passive, hut
without the <foreign xml:lang="greek">Θ</foreign> of the passive stem. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβην</foreign> (βαίνω), <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔδῡν</foreign> (δύω),
ἔγνων (γιγνώσκω), etc. These are athematic (797) of course.</p>

<p>3) Others end in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-α</foreign> and are conjugated with the same endings
as the first (regular) aorists, hut without the <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἶπα</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔκηα.</foreign></p>

<p>4) Many are reduplicated (867), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἤγαγον [ἄγω]</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">κεχαρόμην

[χαίρω].</foreign>

Note. — The stem of the second aorist usually diSers from the
present, regularly standing in ablaut (593-5) relation to it, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">βαίνω,
ἔβην; λείπω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλιπον.

<div type="textpart" n="867">
<p>Reduplication. — The perfect and pluperfect (with a few
presents, second aorists and futures) in all modes have reduplication
(doubling), which regularly denotes completed (sometimes
intensified) action, a state, or a condition.</p>

Dative Case

The Greek dative represents three earlier cases (657):

PRONOUNS</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1028">
<p>The Pronoun ό, ή, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό.</foreign> — There are three chief uses of the
pronoun, <foreign xml:lang="greek">δ</foreign>, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό:</foreign></p>

<p>1) As an independent demonstrative (and third personal) pronoun,
meaning this, that, he, she, it. This is its original use, and
the one most commonly met with in Homer, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁ</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">νονσον ώρσ:</foreign> he
roused a plague, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τον Χρύσην ητίμασιν ἀρητηρα ἀτρείδr/s</foreign> the SOU of
Atreus dishonored that (■well-known) Chryses, the priest, <foreign xml:lang="greek">την δ’ iγω
ον λνσω</foreign> but I will not free her, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ϋδασεν δ’</foreign> b <foreign xml:lang="greek">γύρων</foreign> and that old man
feared.</p>

<p>2) As an article properly speaking (“the”), that is, modifying
and making definite a noun, but not having any particular demonstrative
force. This is its ordinary use in Greek after Homer.</p>

<p>3) As a relative pronoun, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">τον τόκε Ἀητω</foreign> whom Leto bore, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τω
ol ΐσαν κύ/</foreign>pVKC who were his two heralds, <foreign xml:lang="greek">την μοι δόσαν</foreign> viis <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀχαιών</foreign>
whom the sons of the Achaeans gave unto me.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">ΝρτΕ.</foreign> — Many expressions in Homer which are translated into English
by the relative pronoun in a subordinate clause seem to have been
coordinate originally. Thus the pronoun (ό, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign>) in these last three
sentences may well have been thought of as demonstrative with asyndeton
rather than as relative, 1113-1114.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1029">
<p>As air independent pronoun it has two main uses:</p>

<p>1) It is “resumptive,” that is, it refers to something already
mentioned, <foreign xml:lang="greek">Χρύσην ητίμασ(.ν</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο γάρ η\θὶ θοας</foreign> ivi <foreign xml:lang="greek">νηας</foreign> he dishonored
Chryses, for he came to the swift ships.

<pb n="323"/>

</p>

<p>2) It makes a contrast, usually in combinations, such as 6 pkv
... 6 <foreign xml:lang="greek">δε'</foreign>, and other words which help to give this effect.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1030">
<p>ό <foreign xml:lang="greek">μϊν</foreign> ... <foreign xml:lang="greek">δ</foreign> St and ol <foreign xml:lang="greek">μϊν</foreign> ... 61 8« are frequently used
to contrast both definite and indefinite persons and things.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1031">
<p>Its use with an adversative particle generally, but not
always, marks a change of subject, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁ</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">δε</foreign> but the other.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1032">
<p>The use of ό, ή, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign> as an article has evidently arisen from
its employment as an independent pronoun, followed by a noun
in apposition, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">δ’ ἀεκαυσα ἀμα τοισι γυνή</foreign> Kiev but she went with
them against her will, i.e. the woman, where ywi; is added as an
afterthought for the sake of greater definiteness.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1033">
<p>So also it may serve to introduce a new person, in this
case anticipating the noun, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">αντάρ δ μήνα ν-ηνσι παρήμΐνος Sloyevrjs
Πτ^λτ^ος υΙός 7τόδας ώκνζ ἀχιλλενζ</foreign> but he Icept raging as he sat beside
the ships, did the Zeus-born son of Peleus, the swift-footed Achilles.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1034">
<p>With the adjective or participle it is often used as a
substantive, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">το πλΰον</foreign> the greater part, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τα κακὰ</foreign> these calamities,
such calamities (1027).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1035">
<p>It is also used with the neuter accusative, singular or
plural, of the adjective as an adverb, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">τα πρώτα</foreign> at first (780-781).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1036">
<p>On the other hand, the masculine or feminine with an
adverb may be used substantively.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1037">
<p>Nouns with a possessive pronoun take the article only
when they refer to a definite individual, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">το σόν μό/</foreign>os this anger
of yours.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1038">
<p>It usually has a demonstrative force, and its absence
does not mark a noun as indefinite, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">μηνιν ἀαδε</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ΘἈ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδεω
Ἀχιληος</foreign> sing, goddess, the wrath of the son of Peleus, Achilles.</p>

<p>The Personal Pronouns. — The nominative of the personal
pronouns is used mainly for emphasis and contrast, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">συ δε σννθίο</foreign>

is usually omitted, as Ss <foreign xml:lang="greek">ΐφατο</foreign> thus he spoke.</p>

<p>Demonstrative Pronouns. — The demonstrative pronouns
are thus distinguished:</p>

<p>1) (ε) <foreign xml:lang="greek">κείνος</foreign>, ἡ, o is used of .something remote from the speaker.</p>

<p>2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign>, rj, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign> differs from <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐτος</foreign>, (έ)κεΐνος, <foreign xml:lang="greek">όδε</foreign>, etc., in that it usually
marks a contrast in objects, but does not distinguish them as
near and far, present and absent, etc.</p>

<p>3) The compounds of ό, ή, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign> are used of something near the
speaker, or of something associated with him.</p>

<p>4) <foreign xml:lang="greek">σίτο;</foreign> is used of something which has been mentioned ah
ready, or else of something of particular interest or concern to
the second person.</p>

<p>5) 6, ή, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign> in addition to being employed as a relative and as a
personal pronoun is used to mark a contrast.</p>

<p>6) <foreign xml:lang="greek">αντός</foreign> in all its cases regularly means self, but at times may
mean same; it is regularly intensive and is used especially to contrast
a man or an object with other less important details, as
clothing, weapons, and appurtenances of various kinds.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1042">
<p>Possessive Pronouns. — The possessive pronouns are as a

<p>The Interrogative Pronouns. — The interrogative rk, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τί</foreign>

something, any (one), anything may be either substantive or adjective,
but is sometimes almost the equivalent of the English
indefinite article, a(n), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">τινα μάντιν ερείομεν</foreign> let us ask a seer.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1045">
<p>Relative Pronouns. — A relative agrees with its antecedent
in gender and number, but its case depends upon the construction
of the clause in which it stands, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">μηνιν ἀειδε</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">3λγε’
εθηκεν</foreign> sing the wrath which caused Woes.

PREPOSITIONS</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1048">
<p>Most prepositions were originally adverbs (chiefly local),

<div type="textpart" n="1064">
<p>In verbs with both first and second tenses (first aorist,

The Moods in Simple Sentences

The Independent Indicative without <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1092">
<p>Without ἄv or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign> the indicative mood simply states a
fact, either positively or negatively, asks a question, or makes an
exclamation.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1093">
<p>An unattainable wish which refers to the present or to
the past is expressed by a past tense of the indicative with <foreign xml:lang="greek">αἴθε

</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1096">
<p>The past tenses of the indicative may be used with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν</foreign> to denote unreality.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1097">

<p> <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign> may be used with the future indicative with

</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1098">
<p>The subjunctive without <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν</foreign> is used in the first

<div type="textpart" n="1101">
<p>Thd subjunctive is frequently used as nearly the equivalent
of the future indicative, and refers to some future event.
It is usually qualified by <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν</foreign>, and the negative is <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ.</foreign>

The Independent Optative without <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign>. </p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1102">
<p>The independent optative without <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign> is used to

the gods grant to you.

1103 The potential optative (1105), which regularly takes <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign>, is occasionally found without either.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1104">
<p>The optative is employed at times to express a command,
a request, or an exhortation, being practically equivalent
to the imperative.

The Independent Optative with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν</foreign></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1105">
<p>With <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign> the optative is used to express a future

might, could, would, etc.

The Imperative</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1106">
<p>The imperative expresses a command, or a request; the
negative is <foreign xml:lang="greek">μή</foreign>.

The Infinitive</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1107">
<p>1) The only tenses which occur in the infinitive are the
present, future, aorist, perfect, and future perfect. The middle
and passive differ in form in the aorist only.</p>

<p>2) In the subjunctive, optative, imperative, and infinitive, the
tenses do not of themselves indicate time.</p>

<p>3) The present in these moods denotes an action simply as
continued.</p>

<p>4) The aorist denotes an action simply as brought to pass.</p>

<p>5) The perfect denotes an action simply as completed.</p>

<p>6) The subject of an infinitive is usually in the accusative,
but may be omitted when it is the subject of the leading verb, or
its direct or indirect object.</p>

<p>7) The infinitive may be the subject of a verb, especially an
impersonal one, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐστί(ν)</foreign>.</p>

<p>8) It may be the object of a verb, especially verbs indicating
wish, command, advice, consent, attempt,'and the like.</p>

<p>9) The infinitive may depend upon adjectives or substantives,
especially those denoting ability, fitness, willingness, or have a
similar meaning to verbs which take the infinitive (<ref>1107, 7</ref>).</p>

<p>10) The infinitive also may express purpose; the negative is <foreign xml:lang="greek">μή</foreign>.</p>

<p>11) The infinitive is used also to express a command with the
nominative of the second person,- or with the accusative of the
third person for the subject if expressed; the subject may be
omitted. In this usage it is the equivalent of the imperative.

The Participle</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1108">
<p>The participle has only the present, future, aorist, perfect,
and future perfect tenses. It is used attributively as an

<pb n="332"/>

adjective to modify a noun, or the noun may be omitted and the
participle (usually with the pronoun, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τό</foreign>) may be used as a substantive.
Such participles usually indicate time present, past, or
future relatively to the time of the main verb.</p>

<p>Note 1. — The aorist participle may denote time contemporaneous
with the action of the main verb, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">μειδήσασα ἐδέξατο κύπελλον</foreign> she look
Hie cup with a smile.</p>

<p>Note 2.— On the other hand, the present participle may express time
previous to the action of the main verb, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">Χρυσηίδα εἷσεν ἄγων</foreign> leading
Chryseis on board he seated her.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1109">
<p>The participle may express :</p>

<p>1) Time, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">τοῖσι δ’ ἀνιστάμενος μετέφη Ἀχιλλεὺς</foreign> when he had
risen among them Achilles addressed them.</p>

<p>2) Cause.</p>

<p>3) Manner or means.</p>

<p>4) Condition.</p>

<p>5) Purpose or desire (usually the future participle), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">λυσόμενος θύγατρα</foreign> (desiring) to ransom his own daughter; <foreign xml:lang="greek">μαχησόμενος</foreign>
(desiring) to fight, for the purpose of fighting.</p>

<p>6) Concession, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀλόχῳ περ ἐούσῃ</foreign> even though you are my wife.</p>

<p>7) Attendant circumstance.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1110">
<p>The Greek often employs a participle where we should
use a relative clause, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεοὶ Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχοντες</foreign> the gods who
have Olympian homes.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1111">
<p>A noun and a participle, not closely connected grammatically
with the rest of the sentence, may stand by themselves in the
genitive in the construction known as the genitive absolute. See 994.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1112">
<p>This construction arose from the use of the genitive
modified by a participle, where the genitive was dependent upon

<p>When a word ends in a short vowel (and sometimes the
diphthongs at and oi), and the next word begins with a vowel,
the final vowel of the first word is regularly elided (575).</p>

followed by a vowel within the same word.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1174">
<p>If a word ends in a short vowel and the next word

<p>When a word ending in . a vowel is followed by a word

avoided in poetry either 1) by elision; 2) by the use of
movable consonants, 561-563; 3) by the shortening of a final long
vowel or diphthong, 1173; 4) by crasis or synizesis, 586-587.

<div type="textpart" n="1192">
<p>To obtain facility in reading the verse, a considerable
quantity of it should be memorized, special attention being paid
to the quantity (that is, twice as much time should be given to
each long syllable as to a short), and the pauses should be carefully
observed. Although English verse is primarily accentual
rather than quantitative, still the memorizing of a few lines of
English dactylic hexameter (Longfellow’s “ Evangeline,”1 for
example, mediocre though it be) will materially aid in getting the
swing and the movement of the Greek hexameter.

1 This is the forest primaeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,

Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.
