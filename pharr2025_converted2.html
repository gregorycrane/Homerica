               <h3>SUGGESTIONS TO INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS</h3>
               <p>The wise teacher knows what to omit. Try once making all students
                  learn thoroughly one form for each declension and conjugation, using the
                  adjective <i class="greek">καλός, ή, όν</i>, as a model for the first two declensions, <i class="greek">ἄναξ</i> for the
                  third, and as <i class="greek">λύω</i> the model verb. Hold them strictly to these and use all
                  other forms for reference, teaching them so far as practicable, without
                  overloading, as they occur in reading. Lay special emphasis on infinitives
                  and participles, including their meanings, and the declension of the latter.
                  The full grammar of Homeric Greek in this book is given primarily for
                  reference. Reserve a lot of it for second year work and see how much
                  better progress your students make. Have the students recite their model
                  forms, <i class="greek">καλός, ή, όν</i>, <i class="greek">ἄναξ</i>, <i class="greek">λύω</i>, a great deal in concert. At the beginning of
                  each lesson send everybody to the board. The teacher may underline
                  errors as they are made, may make students change places and mark each
                  other&#x27;s work, or may require them to be seated and go over two or three
                  typical exercises, calling on the class to indicate from their seats the various
                  mistakes. Vary the method. When marking errors in written work that
                  has been handed in, never write out the corrections. Underline the errors
                  and require each student to correct his own mistakes. If he must have
                  help, remember that hints are usually more valuable than direct information.
                  Ordinarily spend not less than one third of the time of each recitation
                  on the lesson following. Require the students to look over the vocabulary
                  of the advance lesson, or even to memorize it before coming to class. Then
                  look over with them in class the forms for the next lesson. After that, have
                  them translate at sight the Greek sentences, giving them hints when necessary,
                  particularly reminding them of forms which have not yet been studied,
                  but do not translate for them. They will enjoy this, and it will greatly
                  lighten their burden of preparation. Vary the work continually, giving
                  drills in different ways, occasionally talking informally on Homeric and
                  Greek ideas of various kinds, and particularly giving them some insight into
                  the historical and cultural background of the Homeric poems. A theme of
                  some length from each student at the end of the year often arouses considerable
                  enthusiasm. A great variety of topics for themes can be found in
                  Jebb&#x27;s <em>Introduction to Homer</em>, Ginn &amp; Co. For drill on vocabularies use
                  Owen and Goodspeed&#x27;s <em>Homeric Vocabularies</em>, University of Chicago Press.
                  Cheap texts of the first book of the <em>Iliad</em>, for use in recitation and examinations,
                  are published by Longmans, Green &amp; Co., Macmillan, and several
                  others.</p>

               <h3>PREFACE</h3>
               <p>THIS book, now offered to the public, is the fruit of seven years
                  of experimentation and of much counsel with those interested in
                  the plan which it embodies.</p>
               <p>It has already gone through four mimeographed editions, and
                  has been used for several years: in Ohio Wesleyan University,
                  in Oberlin College, and in Southwestern Presbyterian University.
                  In all these cases it has had marked success in creating and sustaining
                  interest in beginning Greek, where the crux of the whole
                  problem of the future of Hellenic studies lies.</p>
               <p>The reasons which have convinced the author of the necessity
                  for basing the work of beginners on Homeric instead of on Attic
                  Greek will be found in a paper, entitled <em>A Year – or more –
                  of Greek</em>, published in the <em>Classical Journal</em> for February, 1918,
                  and in a second paper, <em>Homer and the Study of Greek</em>, which
                  is printed in this book, following the table of contents. To all
                  who may be interested in the subject, from the standpoint of
                  humanistic studies, the author would heartily commend the reading
                  of Andrew Lang&#x27;s delightful little essay, <em>Homer and the Study
                  of Greek</em>, published in his collection of <em>Essays in Little</em>.</p>
               <p>It is hardly to be hoped that a book of this kind, which seeks to
                  establish a new path to our common goal, will be so free from minor
                  errors as would one along the old established lines. Hence the
                  author will be profoundly grateful to those who will be generous
                  enough to make suggestions looking toward the betterment of the
                  work as well as to those who will be kind enough to point out any
                  errors. Naturally, in a work of this nature, there is the constantly
                  recurring problem of how to reconcile most successfully effective
                  pedagogy and scientific accuracy of statement.</p>

               <span class="page-break" id="p.vi">[pg. vi]</span>
               <p>The book does not pretend to be a text where the advanced
                  Homeric scholar will find catalogued every stray Homeric form, or
                  supposedly Homeric form, but its first object is to teach beginners
                  to read Greek intelligently and with pleasure.</p>
               <p>It is not intended that the ordinary student shall master all the
                  grammar found in this text: much of it is for reference only. But
                  certainly every teacher should have at least this much Homeric
                  grammar thoroughly at command and be overflowing with it, not,
                  however, to the extent of attempting to teach all of it. The prime
                  object of first year work, as so admirably stated by Prof. Gildersleeve,
                  is &quot;a maximum of forms, a minimum of syntax, and early
                  acquaintance with Greek in the mass.&quot; To gain this object, it
                  is necessary to read, read, READ Greek.</p>
               <p>In the paradigms and vocabularies, both simple and compound
                  forms of verbs are used to supplement each other, and a free use
                  of analogy is employed, as is commonly done in books of this
                  kind. In the verbal forms, the augment is regularly supplied when
                  missing.</p>
               <p>Those opposed to the employment of prose sentences in Homeric
                  language will find it easy to omit these; but the author is convinced
                  that a better grasp of Homeric forms can be secured by
                  their use.</p>
               <p>After this book is completed successfully, any one of several
                  roads is open for a continuation of the Greek course :</p>
               <p>(1) Probably the most satisfactory method is to continue for
                  some time with Homer, reading copious extracts from the <em>Iliad</em>
                  and <em>Odyssey</em>. The student is now well prepared to handle successfully
                  the standard school editions of these.</p>
               <p>(2) The passage from Homer to the Attic Drama is an easy one,
                  and is the most satisfactory introduction to the Attic dialect.
                  This is the course which the author would strongly recommend, as
                  most likely to be of the greatest value and as having probably the
                  strongest appeal to the most students. Euripides furnishes the
                  easiest reading, and several of his plays have been published in
                  convenient form with vocabularies (Longmans, Green &amp; Co.),
                  and with both vocabularies and notes (Macmillan &amp; Co.). This
                  could be followed by any one of several possibilities, some more
                  drama, Plato, or the New Testament.</p>

               <span class="page-break" id="p.vii">[pg. vii]</span>
               <p>(3) Some Herodotus could now be read with not much difficulty,
                  and his work would admirably supplement the Homeric stories.</p>
               <p>(4) It is quite possible to read some Plato now, using a good
                  edition of one of the dialogues, with vocabulary and notes, such as
                  that of Seymour and Dyer.</p>
               <p>(5) Many will find a strong appeal in the Lyric Poets, which
                  are very easy after a fair amount of Homer and contain some of the
                  choicest gems in all Greek literature.</p>
               <p>(6) Some may want to read Hesiod, who is the easiest of all
                  authors after Homer. His importance has not always been
                  recognized, and he has been entirely too much neglected in our
                  colleges.</p>
               <p>(7) The New Testament could be studied to good advantage
                  after Homer, and is recommended to those intending to enter the
                  ministry.</p>
               <p>(8) Those who are wedded to Xenophon, who teach him with
                  success, and who feel that he must come early in the course, will
                  find Homer a much better preparation for Xenophon than Xenophon
                  is for Homer. There are a number of good school editions,
                  and students can now read rapidly considerable quantities of the
                  <em>Anabasis</em>, or of any of the other works of Xenophon.</p>
               <p>Other things being equal, the teacher should of course select
                  the author in which he has the greatest interest and for which he
                  has the most enthusiasm. He will find the work not only much
                  easier, but more successful as well.</p>
               <p>To all who have assisted, directly or indirectly, in the production
                  of the present book, the author would here express his sincerest
                  appreciation and gratitude. Lack of space prevents giving a
                  complete list of names, but the author feels that special mention
                  is due to Prof. Francis G. Allinson of Brown University, for generously
                  reading the whole of the manuscript and for making many
                  helpful suggestions; to Prof. Samuel E. Bassett of the University
                  of Vermont, and to Prof. Edward Fitch of Hamilton College, who
                  also went over the manuscript and made many valuable criticisms;
                  to Prof. Walter Petersen of Bethany College, whose help on a number
                  of grammatical problems has been invaluable; to Miss Mabel</p>

               <span class="page-break" id="p.viii">[pg. viii]</span>
               <p>Drennan of the Swanton, Ohio, High School, for making the whole
                  of the two general vocabularies; to Miss Shirley Smith and to
                  Mr. Charles J. Adameç, graduate students at Yale, for checking
                  up the general vocabularies; to Mr. W. J. Millard, student at
                  Southwestern Presbyterian University, for verifying the Biblical
                  quotations; to Prof. Wilmot Haines Thompson of Acadia University,
                  for reading the manuscript, making a number of valuable suggestions,
                  and for much valuable assistance in reading proof; to Prof.
                  Leigh Alexander of Oberlin College, who has generously placed
                  at the disposal of the author the results of two years of experience
                  with the book in his classes, who has read all the proof and has
                  saved the book from a number of errors; to the Boston Museum of
                  Fine Arts, for the loan of some unusually fine photographs for
                  illustrations; to D. C. Heath &amp; Co., for the use of illustrations from
                  Webster&#x27;s <em>Ancient History</em>, one of their texts; to Prof. Frank E.
                  Robbins of the University of Michigan, and to the <em>Classical
                  Journal</em>, for permission to use Prof. Robbins&#x27;s valuable statistics
                  on Greek verb forms, which appeared in the <em>Classical Journal</em>,
                  15, 2; to Dr. Alice Braunlich of the Davenport High School, to
                  Prof. G. B. Waldrop of the Westminster School, and to Dr. D. W.
                  Abercrombie, recently of Worcester Academy, for help in reading
                  the proof; and to the J. S. Cushing Company (The Norwood
                  Press) for their very careful and painstaking typographical work.</p>
               <p>If this book will contribute to the value and interest of the study
                  of beginning Greek, the author will feel that his seven years of
                  work upon it have not been spent in vain. The time has come
                  when lovers of the humanities everywhere must join hands in
                  the promotion of the common cause. If anything seems to be of
                  mutual advantage, we must first test it carefully and then hold
                  fast to it if we find it good. Then, to all teachers of Greek and
                  every true friend of humanistic studies and of culture in its best
                  sense, the author would say in conclusion:</p>

   <h3>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</h3>
   <p>In an article entitled <em>A Year - or more - of Greek</em>, contributed
      to the February, 1918, number of the <em>Classical Journal</em>,
      the author sets forth a few of the more important reasons why
      the present system of teaching beginners in Greek should be
      revised to meet modern conditions. The sum and substance of
      the article was a plea for the abandonment of Xenophon for beginning
      work, something which should have been done years ago,
      and the substitution of Homer in his place. The paper embodied
      the results of several years of experimentation; and the primary
      reason urged for the change was based on the comparative literary
      value of the two authors and their appeal to beginning students.
      As we view the situation to-day, we are compelled to confess that
      in the hands of the average teacher, when applied to the average
      student, Xenophon and all his works are all too often found to be
      tedious and dreary. This leaves out of count the exceptional
      teacher, who has large and enthusiastic classes in the <em>Anabasis</em>
      year after year, for such teachers could make any subject fascinating.
      Homer on the other hand possesses those qualities which
      make him especially interesting, as well as of permanent value, to
      the majority of students who still take Greek.</p>
   <p>In this connection the author may be permitted to quote from
      the article just mentioned:<span class="tooltip" id="note-1"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[1]</sup><span class="tooltip-text">C. J. 13, 5.</span></span></p>
   <span>
      <p>The reasons which make Homer
         so desirable are apparent when once the question is seriously
         considered. His work is homogeneous in vocabulary, in literary
         style and idioms employed, and in metrical form; so that when
         students once get a fair start in him, further progress becomes
         easier and more accelerated. He employs all three persons, with
         all modes and tenses of the verb, so that all forms that are learned
         <span class="page-break" id="p.xiv">[pg. xiv]</span>
         are used enough to be kept fresh in the students&#x27; mind and do not
         have to be learned again when they begin anything which is in
         dialogue form. His vocabulary is fairly limited, enough so in
         fact that it does not present any special difficulty to the beginner.
         His sentences are short, simple, and clear-cut, having none of the
         involved structure which makes so much of Xenophon really too
         difficult for first-year work. The verse, which has been considered
         a bar, is an actual help, as it is quite easily learned and is a marked
         aid in memorizing considerable portions of Greek, which is important
         at this stage. Furthermore, the rules of quantity are a
         considerable help in simplifying and illustrating the principles of
         accent. As he uses only one type of verse, and that the simplest
         — the dactylic hexameter — the ordinary student usually becomes
         quite adept at reading this before the end of the first year&#x27;s work.</p>
      <p>The prose composition for the first year&#x27;s work may be based
         upon Homer, the students using Homeric forms and constructions,
         without knowing of the existence of any other kind. This may be
         done without the slightest fear of blunting their sense of discrimination
         between poetic and prose diction and style, a sense
         which cannot possibly be developed until they have had several
         years&#x27; work and have read a considerable amount of Greek in both
         prose and poetry. Homer is so straightforward and simple in
         what he has to say, with nothing obscure, mystical, or far-fetched
         in any way, that he is quite intelligible to the average high-school
         freshman; and at the same time he possesses the qualities of high
         literary art in such a marked degree that he appeals strongly to
         the oldest and most advanced members of any college class.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Homer is the best possible preparation for all
         later Greek literature, much of which is unintelligible without
         a fair knowledge of him. He was to Greek literature what the
         Bible has been to English, and a great deal more as well. He leads
         us somewhere, not merely into a blind alley as does Xenophon,
         both with reference to later Greek literature and to much of the
         best in later European literature as well, where his influence has
         been incalculable and perhaps greater than that of any other
         single writer. In him are the germs of so many things. We have
         <span class="page-break" id="p.xv">[pg. xv]</span>
         the narrative highly developed, the beginning of the drama,
         oratory, statecraft, seamanship, war, adventure, and religion —
         in fact, life as it was to the old Greeks in its manifold aspects.</p>
      <p>Then the student who has taken only a very little of beginning
         Greek, even if he has progressed no farther than the end of the
         first book of the <em>Iliad</em>, has come into vital contact with the magic
         and the music of the Greek language, used in one of the most
         beautiful, one of the most varied, and one of the most influential
         literary compositions of all ages; and though he may have devoted
         considerable labor to mining the gold, he cannot truthfully say,
         and probably will not want to say, that Greek for him has been a
         waste of time.</p>
   </span>
   <p>To begin the study of Greek with Homer, it would be necessary
      to substitute Homeric for Attic Greek for the work of the first year:
      the student would be taught Homeric forms and constructions as a
      basis for future work, and would devote to the study of Homer
      the time which is now occupied by Xenophon. It is the purpose
      of the present paper to develop more in detail some of the most
      important reasons which make such a change not only desirable
      but imperative if Greek is to be saved as a vital factor in our educational
      system.</p>
   <p>The idea of such a plan first suggested itself to the writer several
      years ago, when, full of boundless enthusiasm for his subject
      and for all things Greek, he was attempting to teach first-year
      work and Xenophon, and was compelled to admit to himself that
      his efforts were not meeting with what might be called success.
      Too many good students refused to take Greek in the first place,
      and of those who did enlist, too many, even of the better ones, were
      discouraged by the unending round of grammatical forms, leading
      up to an author whose works are not of a nature to fire the imagination
      and stir the hearts in the breasts of our youth, as can be,
      and is, done by the great masterpieces of Hellas such as the <em>Iliad</em>
      and the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
   <p>The writer would like to make it plain that he is not a hater of
      Xenophon, but that he greatly enjoyed his first year of Greek,
      taken in the old way, as well as his Xenophon, later. The same
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xvi">[pg. xvi]</span>
      is probably true of most classical scholars. This goes a long way
      toward explaining why they are now teaching Greek and Latin
      instead of sociology or mechanical engineering. It would be distinctly
      misleading however for those who have a special taste
      for linguistic work and who enjoyed reading the production of
      such authors as Caesar and Xenophon to infer therefrom that
      their case is at all typical of the mass of students who take these
      subjects. Although the description in Andrew Lang&#x27;s essay,
      <em>Homer and the Study of Greek</em>, is probably too highly colored,
      the account that he gives of his own experience and that of his
      fellows in the study of beginning Greek and Xenophon ought to
      have a lesson and a warning for every one who is still a friend of
      the classics. He makes it quite plain that they found Xenophon
      anything but inspiring, and that most of them thoroughly hated
      him, an experience of many good students, which is too common
      to be ignored.</p>
   <p>It is only fair to state that although this idea of beginning Greek
      with the reading of Homer is original with the writer, it is not
      new. This was the regular method employed by the old Romans
      in teaching their boys Greek, and it was highly commended by
      that capable and judicious old schoolmaster, Quintilian, as the
      best possible plan. Since that time it has been used now and then
      by some of the world&#x27;s ablest educators and scholars. It was thus
      that Joseph Scaliger (de la Scala), one of the most brilliant
      names in the whole history of classical scholarship, taught himself
      Greek at Paris; and many more of the great scholars of the past
      learned their Greek through Homer. It was tried also by Herbart,
      who began a series of experiments in Switzerland, in 1797, where he
      employed this method with marked success in private tutoring.
      Later he continued his experiments on a larger scale in the teachers&#x27;
      training college at Koenigsberg, with such good results that he
      was thoroughly convinced that this was the only suitable method
      of teaching beginning Greek. At his suggestion it was tried by
      Dissen, by Ferdinand Ranke, and by Hummel, all of whom were
      hearty in its praise; and, most important of all, by Ahrens, at
      Hanover, where it was used for thirty years (1850-1881), with
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xvi-plate">[pg. xvi-plate]</span>
   </p>
   <span>
      <h3>THE VAPHIO GOLD CUPS</h3>
      <h3>National Museum, Athens</h3>
      <span>These beautiful objects were found in 1888 A.D., within a &quot;bee-hive&quot; tomb at Vaphio in Laconia. The two cups are of beaten gold, ornamented with designs in repoussé work. The first scene represents a wild-bull hunt. The companion piece pictures four tame bulls under the care of a herdsman.</span>

      <span class="page-break" id="p.xvii">[pg. xvii]</span>
      great success, but was finally abandoned because of the lack of
      suitable text books and because of the opposition of other Gymnasia
      which refused to adopt such a revolutionary plan. It has also
      been recommended occasionally, but without success, by other
      scholars and humanists, notably by Goethe, by Andrew Lang,
      and by Wilamowitz, in Europe; while in America it has been
      advocated in one form or another by Seymour, Bolling, Shorey,
      Lane Cooper, and others. But hitherto no systematic series of
      text books has been issued which are so well adapted to carry the
      students through Homer and introduce them to Attic Greek as the
      ones which have been worked out in connection with Xenophon.
      It has become highly important that this lack be supplied, if possible,
      in order that this plan, which has been tried by several
      with such good success, may be tested on a wider scale, so that we
      may see whether or no it will succeed in the hands of the average
      teacher of beginning Greek. Thus students should be prepared
      to strike immediately into the heart of Greek literature, instead
      of having to go a long way around, as at present.</p>
   <p>As to the superiority of Homer over Xenophon, from the standpoint
      of literary values, and of interest for the average student,
      there can be no quarrel. It remains for us to investigate the
      relative advantages and demerits of each as mediums for teaching
      the language.</p>
   <p>In the first place it is essential that we disabuse our minds of the
      once prevalent notion, long since exploded, but still more or less
      consciously held by many, that the Attic dialect is the norm by
      which all other Greek is to be judged. The language of Homer is
      earlier and naturally differs from it in many essentials; therefore
      it was long maintained that Homeric Greek is irregular, crude and
      unfinished. Hellenistic Greek, which represents a later development
      of the language, has its differences; therefore Hellenistic
      Greek must be degenerate. Such an idea is utterly unscientific
      and ignores completely the modern historical point of view of the
      development and growth of languages. Any period which has
      given birth to literary productions of surpassing merit and artistic
      excellence is justified by its own works; it contains its own linguistic

      standards, and will richly repay those who take the trouble
      to study it. To call Homeric Greek anomalous and irregular,
      because it differs in some particulars from the Attic dialect, is as
      misleading as it would be to say that the language of Shakespeare
      is immature and eccentric because he does not write the same type
      of English as does George Ade or Stephen Leacock. As a matter
      of fact, the language of the Homeric poems is quite as finished, has
      quite as many virtues, and is quite as much of a norm for its
      period and style of composition as Xenophon is for his; and the
      different forms in Homer are no more aberrations on his part than
      those of Xenophon are marks of degeneracy for him. And Attic
      Greek, after all, is but one of a number of dialects, coming at neither
      end but in the middle of the development of the Greek language.
      It is rarely found pure in any of the great authors, and in none
      which are suitable for beginners.</p>
   <p>According to our present system, students are taught a smattering
      of Attic Greek. Then they are given a smattering of Homer,
      who represents a period several centuries earlier. Then again
      comes some more Attic Greek, and if the student continues in his
      work he usually gets some Doric, with sometimes a little Lesbian,
      and the Ionic of Herodotus, to which is commonly added a dash
      of the Koinè for further confusing variety. All of this comes at
      such times and at such points in his development that it is practically
      impossible for the ordinary student to obtain a clear conception
      of what the Greek language is like and what are the fundamental
      processes of its development. As a result grammar becomes
      a nightmare to be dreaded instead of an opportunity to study the
      structure of one of the most interesting and instructive languages
      in existence. This has reference to the linguistic features, apart
      from its literary value. If on the other hand we begin with Homer
      and obtain a good grounding in his language, the transition from
      that to later Greek is simple and natural and in accordance with
      well-established laws, so that a student who once gets a grasp
      of the processes involved not only has acquired a valuable scientific
      point of view, but he might be untrue enough to the traditions of
      countless students of the past to find Greek grammar interesting.</p>
   <p>
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xix">[pg. xix]</span>
      Furthermore, since most of us learned our Attic Greek first,
      when we came to Homeric Greek and found so many different
      forms, the feeling very naturally arose with many that Homer has
      many more forms than Attic Greek, and that they are more difficult.
      On the contrary, the Homeric forms are not only simpler and more
      transparent than the Attic and as a consequence more easily
      learned — many Attic forms have to be explained by a reference
      to the Homeric ones — but the Homeric forms are considerably
      fewer in number. This is best seen by a reference to the declensional
      endings, as exemplified in the two tables, 479, 649.
      From these tables we see that there are, all told, 86 Homeric
      forms of the noun and adjective to be learned as against 108 Attic
      forms. But this is not all. Many forms in both Attic and
      Homeric Greek are so rare that it would be manifestly absurd to
      compel first-year students to memorize them. For our purposes,
      then, we must omit the unusually rare forms from both tables.
      In the first table (479) we shall omit a number of forms which
      many would include, and count only those not inclosed in brackets
      which are regularly included as essential by the standard beginners&#x27;
      books based on the Attic dialect. We shall not count the very
      rare Homeric forms, but shall be liberal enough to include a few
      which are too rare to be learned in reading Homer but are important
      for students intending to read Attic Greek later. We
      find then that students who begin with Homeric Greek need to
      learn only 55 forms as against 80 (88 according to some) of
      the Attic. This means that it is necessary to memorize about
      fifty per cent more forms in order to be able to read the first
      four books of the <em>Anabasis</em> than it would be to read the first
      six books of the <em>Iliad</em>. Furthermore, in the pronouns, by not
      compelling the student to memorize any form which does not
      occur on an average of at least once every two or three thousand
      verses, there would be fewer Homeric forms to be learned here
      also. The same is true of the verbs. The reflexive pronoun, for
      example, and the future passive and future optative of verbs are
      not found in Homer; the middle voice regularly retains the uncontracted
      forms of the endings and not in a part only as in Attic
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xx">[pg. xx]</span>
      Greek; and in many other ways the forms are simpler and more
      easily learned. In fact many books for beginners find it easier to
      teach Attic Greek by a constant reference to the earlier forms,
      which in many cases are the Homeric.</p>
   <p>The occasional irregular forms, which are omitted from the
      ones to be learned, should be grouped in some convenient way for
      reference, but need not be memorized, as they are regularly given
      in their alphabetical place in the vocabulary of any good school
      edition and in the ordinary lexicons. Thus the student need
      not be required to memorize the five forms of the present infinitive
      of <i class="greek">εἰμί</i>, or the five forms of the genitive of <i class="greek">ἐγώ</i>, e.g., but could
      learn one of each and not burden his memory with forms which
      are found in every vocabulary.</p>
   <p>Many Atticists have maintained that the great number of
      irregularities in Homeric Greek would be an added difficulty to the
      beginner. It is true that they are troublesome, but not so troublesome
      as the considerably greater number of irregularities in Attic
      Greek. Any one who will take the trouble to count them will
      find that the irregular formations in Attic Greek considerably
      outnumber those in Homer. There is not space here to catalogue
      the various irregularities, heteroclites, metaplastic forms, etc., of
      Attic Greek, but the lists given in Kuehner-Blass, or any other of
      the more elaborate Greek grammars, are enough to convince the
      most skeptical.</p>
   <p>If we leave aside the irregularities and look at a few regular
      formations which must be memorized, the evidence is none the less
      conclusive. For example, the &quot;regular&quot; declensions of such words
      as <i class="greek">πόλις</i>, <i class="greek">βασιλεύς</i>, <i class="greek">ναῦς</i>, <i class="greek">πῆχυς</i>, <i class="greek">ἄστυ</i>, comparatives in <i class="greek">-των</i>, and other
      forms which will readily occur to any one who has studied Attic
      Greek, are so complicated that they are not ordinarily mastered by
      students of beginning Greek, and it would be rather remarkable
      if they were. Or let us consider a single class, such as typical
      words of the third declension in <i class="greek">υς</i>, as <i class="greek">πήχυς</i>, <i class="greek">δίπηχυς</i>, <i class="greek">ἡδύς</i>, <i class="greek">ἔγχελυς</i>,
      <i class="greek">ἰχθύς</i>. If the student learned the declension of any one of these,
      and attempted to decline the rest accordingly, he would go far
      astray; for of these five words, all of the third declension, and all
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxi">[pg. xxi]</span>
      ending in <i class="greek">υς</i> in the nominative, no two are declined alike
      throughout. A comparison of the declensions of <i class="greek">ἔγχελυς</i> (eel) with
      that of <i class="greek">ἰχθύς</i> (fish) will illustrate the point. It seems that the old
      Athenians were never able to decide definitely whether an eel
      was a fish or a serpent. Accordingly, we find that they declined
      <i class="greek">ἔγχελυς</i> the first half of the way like <i class="greek">ἰχθύς</i>, while the other
      half was different. What a pity that there are not a few more
      such convenient mnemonic devices to help the student keep his
      bearings on his way through the maze of Greek morphology!</p>
   <p>If a student finally learned to decline such a word as <i class="greek">vaûs</i>, he would
      not know how to begin the declension of another word formed in
      the same way, such as <i class="greek">γραῦς</i>; nor would a student who had
      learned the declension of <i class="greek">βοῦς</i> in Attic Greek know the declension
      of the next word like it, <i class="greek">χοῦς</i>, and he might be led
      very far astray by such a simple and common word as <i class="greek">νοῦς</i>.</p>
   <p>All of these forms, and many more which could be cited, are highly
      interesting to philologists, as they illustrate so beautifully certain
      abstruse principles in Greek phonology and morphology. Unfortunately
      they do not usually have the same strong appeal to
      the beginner who is trying very hard to learn how to read
      Greek.</p>
   <p>The whole system of contraction, which is regular at times, and
      the variations caused by it in the general rules of accent and
      quantity, all of which are so confusing and so difficult to the
      ordinary beginner, are so little used in Homer that they can very
      profitably be omitted, or else touched quite lightly, and the time
      saved can be invested elsewhere to much greater advantage.</p>
   <p>In the field of syntax Homer is so much simpler than Xenophon
      that students ordinarily find him a great deal easier. Thus
      Homer lacks the articular infinitive; long and involved passages
      in indirect discourse never occur, as well as many other strange
      and foreign characteristics of Attic Greek and Xenophon, all of
      which give a great deal of trouble to the ordinary beginner.
      These elements all contribute to a quicker and an easier learning
      of Greek through Homer, as has been abundantly proved by experiments
      also. Thus students who begin with Homer regularly read


      

      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxii">[pg. xxii]</span>
more Greek in the time devoted to him than do those who begin
      with Xenophon and spend this time on the Anabasis.</p>
   <p>It has long been a commonly accepted myth that Homer has
      such an enormous vocabulary that students would have more
      than ordinary trouble with it. In fact the vocabulary of the first
      six books of the <em>Iliad</em> is no larger than that required for reading the
      <em>Anabasis</em>, and one can read the whole of the Homeric poems, including
      the hymns, without having to learn many more words
      than to read Xenophon, and without having to learn so many
      words as are necessary for the reading of Plato.</p>
   <p>There are, it is true, a great number of words in Homer which are
      used only once (<i class="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</i>).<span class="tooltip" id="note-1"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[1]</sup><span class="tooltip-text">L. Friedländer, Zwei hom. Wörterverzeichnisse.</span></span> The <em>Iliad</em> has 1097 of these,
      while the <em>Odyssey</em> has 868, making a total of 1965. However,
      this is not nearly so large as the number used by Xenophon, who
      has 3021 <i class="greek">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</i>, of which 433 are in the <em>Anabasis</em>, as compared
      with 266 (238 if we omit the Catalogue of Ships) in the first
      six books of the <em>Iliad</em>.<span class="tooltip" id="note-2"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[2]</sup><span class="tooltip-text">G. Sauppe, Xen. Op. V, 298.</span></span></p>
   <p>It is highly important too in gaining a vocabulary to learn words
      which will be used in other authors read later in the course, and to
      acquire so far as possible the more fundamental meanings of words
      from which their later uses are derived. Ahrens, who made a
      careful study of this problem, gives the palm to Homer here without
      question. According to him, the words in Homer are much
      nearer their fundamental meanings, and take on different shades of
      significance in the various later authors. If one wishes to obtain
      a clear grasp of Greek onomatology and semasiology, he should
      begin with Homer by all means and would thus be prepared to
      see more readily the later turns in the meanings of words and
      phrases, which in many cases vary considerably in authors of the
      same period, and sometimes even in the same author. Thus there
      are over 400 words in the <em>Anabasis</em> which either do not occur
      at all in Xenophon&#x27;s other works, or else with a different signification.
      Rutherford (The New Phryn., 160 ff.) says:</p>
   <span class="page-break" id="p.xxiii">[pg. xxiii]</span>
   <span>
      <p>...
         escape the notice of later Greeks that Xenophon&#x27;s diction was very
         different from that of pure Attic writers, and there are still extant
         several remarks upon this point.
         A busy man, living almost
         wholly abroad, devoted to country pursuits and the life of the
         camp, attached to the Lacedaemonian system of government, and
         detesting the Athenian, Xenophon must have lost much of the
         refined Atticism with which he was conversant in his youth. It is
         not only in the forms of words that he differs from Attic writers,
         but he also uses many terms — the <i class="greek">ὀνόματα γλωσσηματικά</i> of
         Galen — altogether unknown to Attic prose, and often assigns to
         Attic words a meaning not actually attached to them in the
         leading dialect.</p>
   </span>
   <p>When it comes to the actual number of words of Xenophon and
            Homer which enter into the vocabulary of other Greek writers,
            the following tables will show their relation to some of the most
            important authors read in college.</p>

        <span class="page-break" id="p.xxiv">[pg. xxiv]</span>
        <p>The vocabularies of Xenophon and Homer, which are compared
            in these lists, are: Xenophon&#x27;s <em>Anabasis</em> entire, and Homer&#x27;s
            <em>Iliad</em>, books I-VI. The pages as given above are according to
            the Teubner texts. The number of words in Xenophon&#x27;s <em>Anabasis</em>
            is approximately the same as that of Homer&#x27;s <em>Iliad</em>, books I-VI.</p>
        
   <p>In these lists, words which are closely enough related to others
      that ordinary students who know the meaning of one may infer
      the other are counted but once, as <i class="greek">θάνατος</i>, <i class="greek">ἀθάνατος</i>; <i class="greek">βαίνω</i>, <i class="greek">ἐκβαίνω</i>,
      <i class="greek">καταβαίνω</i>, <i class="greek">ἀναβαίνω</i>, etc. Proper names are also omitted.</p>
   <p>From this table it will be seen that Homer is a much better
      preparation for the Greek drama, Hesiod, the elegiac and iambic
      poets, than is Xenophon, and it is along these lines that the course
      should be developed. For Plato the difference is so exceedingly
      slight that in the matter of vocabulary one is practically as good a
      preparation as the other, and a few of his easier dialogues should
      find a place after some of the best poetry has been read. After
      that the Greek course ought to be able to take care of itself. Herodotus
      might come at any point. There is a slight advantage here
      on the side of Xenophon in the matter of vocabulary, but his
      language is so much closer to that of Homer, as well as his general
      style and imaginative genius, that he would be very easy and
      stimulating to those who had read any considerable amount of
      Homeric Greek. Those who wished to read Thucydides and the
      orators would find Xenophon&#x27;s vocabulary somewhat better for
      their purpose, and the same is true if they wished to read the
      New Testament and Menander; but in all these the advantage
      is relatively slight, and in most cases the difference would probably
      not be noticeable. In the case of the New Testament, for example,
      the difference is less than one word in two Teubner pages of Greek
      text.</p>
   <p>It is generally recognized that for the best results in the study
      of the New Testament, students should read a considerable amount
      of other Greek first. In the whole circle of Greek literature the
      two authors most important for the student of the New Testament
      are Homer and Plato. Herodotus informs us that Homer and
      Hesiod were the chief sources of the Greek popular religion; and
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxv">[pg. xxv]</span>
      certainly one cannot obtain a clear grasp of the forces opposed to
      Christianity without a good knowledge of Homer and of the hold
      that Homer had upon the popular mind. If one is to read intelligently
      the works of the early church fathers, he must be well
      acquainted at first hand with Homer. It is Homer, Homer&#x27;s
      religion, and Homer&#x27;s gods which recur constantly in their works
      and which are attacked over and over again as being the bulwarks of
      the heathen faith which they are striving to supplant. Homer and
      the ideas he represents are infinitely more important for the student
      of the New Testament and of the early church than is Xenophon;
      and if one can study not more than a year or so of Greek before
      taking up the New Testament, he should by all means have some
      Homer followed by Plato. Experience has shown that after a
      year of Homer, students can and do pass with little difficulty
      into the New Testament. The passage from Homer to Attic, or
      to Hellenistic, Greek is of course a great deal easier than vice versa,
      and occupies very little time and effort.</p>
   <p>Some have urged that since the bulk of the work in the ordinary
      college course in Greek is in the Attic dialect, students who begin
      with this would get a firmer grasp of it than if they began with
      Homer. Some even feel that a student who did his beginning
      work in Homeric forms would never be able to feel thoroughly at
      home in Attic Greek. Yet few teachers would be rash enough to
      suggest that because a student has had a thorough training in
      Attic Greek he is thereby disqualified from doing first-class work
      in the language of the Hellenistic period, nor would many teachers
      of New Testament Greek, e.g., object to a student who wished
      to specialize in their subject, or even in Patristic Greek, if he came
      to them with a good knowledge of Plato. Students who wish to
      specialize in Pliny and Tacitus, or even in Mediaeval Latin, do
      not find themselves handicapped because they did their earlier
      work in such authors as Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, and
      Catullus. Teachers of the Romance languages also universally
      recognize that a thorough course in Latin is a prerequisite for the
      highest type of scholarship in their field, and no student could
      hope to do advanced linguistic work in any of these languages
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxvi">[pg. xxvi]</span>
      without a thorough training in Latin. In the same way Homer
      offers an unexcelled preparation not only for all later Greek literature
      but for the later language as well; and instead of the present
      system of confusion in the teaching of Greek grammar, particularly
      with reference to the various dialects, some attempt should be
      made to develop the subject in a more scientific fashion.</p>
   <p>Some feel that Homer is too beautiful and too exquisite to be
      used as a <i>corpus vile</i> for the teaching of Greek grammar. But
      the very fact that he is so beautiful and so exquisite is the very
      reason why he should be used at this early stage, that the students
      may have an added incentive for learning their grammar, and may
      not come to hate and despise the whole subject. Thus they may
      see, even from the beginning, that Greek is something worth
      working at, and they may have material interesting enough that
      the necessary grammatical drill will not seem so much useless
drudgery.</p>
   <p>A highly important consideration in placing Homer before Xenophon
      in the curriculum is the fact that as matters now stand such a
      large per cent of our students never reach Homer. The problem
      before us with regard to these students is whether we are to give
      them Xenophon or Homer. Since they represent a very large
      element, not all of whom are loafers either, we owe it to ourselves
      and to the cause of Greek, as well as to them, to give them that
      which will be of most lasting value to them.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Homer is interesting not only to older students, but
      is particularly adapted to the youngest who now take Greek, as
      the earliest experiments, made with boys from nine to fourteen
      years of age, have amply demonstrated. He serves the double
      purpose of introducing them adequately to the language and of
      furnishing them with reading material as interesting as can be
      found in any literature, something too of permanent value; and
      he should come by all means as early as possible in the course, that
      he may serve as a suitable basis for the development of those
      qualities of taste and appreciation, without which the study of
      all art is in vain. And after we have begun with him, we find his
      treasures inexhaustible. In Herbart&#x27;s expressive phrase, “Homer
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxvii">[pg. xxvii]</span>
      elevates the student without depressing the teacher.&quot; To quote
      further from his lectures on education, he says (VI, 283):</p>
   <span>
      <p>The
         reasons for giving the preference to Homer&#x27;s <em>Odyssey</em> in early instruction
         are well known. Any one who reads the <em>Odyssey</em> carefully,
         with an eye to the various main classes of interest which are
         to be aroused by education, can discover the reasons. The point,
         however, to be gained here is not merely to produce a direct effect,
         but beyond that to get points of connection for progressive instruction.
         There can be no better preparation for ancient history
         than gaining interest for ancient Greece by the Homeric stories.
         The ground is prepared for both the cultivation of taste and the
         study of languages at the same time.</p>
      <p>Philologists will be obliged sooner or later to listen to reasons
         of this kind, which are actually derived from the chief aim of all
         instruction, and are only opposed by tradition (the conventional
         study of Latin). This they must do, unless they desire that now,
         with the growth of history and science, and the pressure of material
         interests, Greek should be restricted in schools as Hebrew is at
         present.</p>
      <p>The <em>Odyssey</em>, it is true, possesses no magic power to animate
         those who are entirely unsuccessful in languages, or who do not
         work at them seriously; nevertheless it surpasses in definite educative
         influence, as is proved by the experience of many years,
         every other work of classic times that could be chosen.</p>
   </span>
   <p>In conclusion the writer would earnestly suggest that it is high
      time that Xenophon be omitted completely from at least the first
      three years of Greek study. The time and labor now devoted to
      both Xenophon and Homer should be spent on Homer alone, and
      for the three books of the <em>Iliad</em> and the four books of the <em>Anabasis</em>
      usually read should be substituted a course in Homer which would
      be extensive enough to give the students a real insight into his
      poetry, that they may learn to wander for themselves in the realms
      of gold, that they may be allowed to become so familiar with his language
      and his style that reading from him will be a pleasure and
      not a lot of hard work to be waded through, that they may become
      so filled with his spirit that they may catch a glimpse of what it
      <span class="page-break" id="p.xxviii">[pg. xxviii]</span>
      means to be Homeric, and in later years, if they have gone out
      into other fields and would like to turn back to Greek literature,
      it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to bring out
      their old book and enter again with delight into his world of song.</p>
   <p>In the secondary schools we should have a course in Homer comprehensive
      enough to enable the students to obtain a firm grounding
      in his language and ideas, instead of the present smattering
      of both Xenophon and Homer, neither of which the average student
      knows well enough for it to serve as a stable and satisfactory basis
      for future work. It would be a real step forward on the part of
      the colleges, and should largely increase the number of those now
      offering Greek for admission, if the requirements in Greek should
      be made a requirement in Homer only, due attention being paid to
      composition and grammar, of course. Thus the secondary schools
      could intensify their efforts on one dialect and on one homogeneous
      mass of literature, which would materially simplify their problems,
      and ought to produce a much higher grade of work than is possible
      at present. If colleges would admit students on one, two, and three
      years, respectively, of Homer, with due credit for each, and reserve
      all work in the Attic dialect for the college course proper,
      the secondary teachers would have their burdens greatly lightened,
      with a corresponding increase in effectiveness. In no other language
      do the secondary schools undertake to prepare a student
      in two separate dialects. To do so in Greek is a pedagogical
      blunder which should be perpetuated no longer.</p>

    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <h3>I</h3>
    <p>THE <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, the two great Greek epics, and the greatest of all epic poems, belong to the earliest Greek literature that has been preserved.</p>
    <p>Their action and stories are legendary and are grouped around the incidents concerning the long siege of Troy by the Greeks, its final capture and destruction, and the return of the Greeks home. No attempt is made to give a systematic account of those events, but certain leading features of the legends are developed.</p>
    <p>The <em>Iliad</em> has for its central theme and as the thread upon which it strings its various events the <i>Menis</i>, the mad anger of Achilles, and its dire consequences to the Greeks.</p>
    <p>According to the story, Paris, son of King Priam of Troy (Ilios) in Asia Minor, eloped with Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, in southern Greece. The Greeks united under the command of King Agamemnon of Mycenae, brother of Menelaus, and the most powerful of the Greek chieftains, to avenge this wrong, capture Troy, and bring back Helen. After ten years of preparation they gathered their forces, sailed across the Aegean to the shores of the Hellespont (Dardanelles), landed, and drew up their ships, out of the water, in long lines on the shore. For ten years the siege continued before the Greeks were able to capture the city.</p>
    <p>The <em>Iliad</em> opens, in the ninth year of the siege, with the deadly quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles. Before all the assembled Greeks, Agamemnon disgraces and humiliates Achilles, and robs him of his prize of honor which had been previously bestowed upon him by the army. In rage and disgust, Achilles retires from <span class="page-break" id="p.xxx">[pg. xxx]</span> the conflict and sulks in his tent. As he had been their stoutest warrior, his absence is keenly felt by the Greeks, who suffer many defeats and heavy losses at the hands of the Trojans, now that Achilles has withdrawn. It is only the death of his bosom friend, Patroclus, in battle, which furnishes a motive sufficiently powerful to induce him to take a further part in the war. To avenge his death, Achilles enters the conflict once more, and kills Hector, who had slain Patroclus. Shortly thereafter he was himself killed by an arrow shot by Paris with the help of Apollo. Finally, in the tenth year of the siege, Troy was captured by the Greeks, by means of the well-known stratagem of the Wooden Horse. The city was plundered and burned; the men were killed and the women taken as slaves. Helen was recovered; and after many adventures and losses by shipwreck and other misfortunes the Greeks returned home.</p>
    <p>The traditional date of the fall of Troy was <span>1184 B.C.</span> The date of the Homeric poems is not at all certain. Some think they are as early as <span>850 B.C.</span>, while others would date them as late as the latter part of the seventh century B.C. Many scholars have thought that the poems represent a gradual growth of a long period of time, that they were composed by a number of different bards, and have been worked over, edited and re-edited, till they gradually acquired their present form. Many of these scholars would deny that any one by the name of Homer ever lived. Others think that Homer was one of the editors, perhaps the most important of the editors, of the poems, that he may have composed a considerable amount of material in them, but that his chief function consisted in combining and working over the various lays handed down by his predecessors. Still others are of the opinion that the whole of the poems, or practically all of them, as we have them, were composed outright by a single poet, who was a real historical character, and whose name was Homer. Most are agreed that there must have been some great, master mind, whose influence is felt throughout the poems, but who made free use of the work of other poets who had preceded him and who had sung of various events connected with the same theme. As Kipling would say:</p>

        </div>
    </span>
    <p>The old Greeks were practically unanimous in believing that the poems were composed by a bard, named Homer, and that he traveled about, in various parts of Greece, a poor, old, blind beggar, eking out an existence by singing his poems. After his death, we are told that: <span>Seven cities claimed the Homer dead, through which the living Homer begged his bread.</span> The chief contestants for the honor of his birthplace were Smyrna and Chios, and the evidence of the poems would seem to point to that region.</p>

    </span>
    <p>The poems represent a very unsettled condition of society in the Greek world, corresponding in many ways to the Middle Ages in Europe. Preceding this period, there had been a brilliant civilization in the Greek world in the Aegean basin. This civilization is generally called the Minoan or Aegean civilization. Its flourishing period extended from about <span>2500 B.C.</span> to about <span>1500 B.C.</span>, but it was not completely overthrown till about <span>1000 B.C.</span> Its chief center in early times was Crete, where recent excavations have revealed the existence of the seat of a great island empire. Its commerce and its influence touched all the shores of the Mediterranean, and it seems to have been in vital touch with the early Babylonian and Egyptian cultures. Other centers were Mycenae,

          <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxii">[pg. xxxii]</span>

    Argos, Athens, Pylus, and Sparta, in Europe, and Troy in Asia Minor.</p>
    <p>It was finally destroyed by invasions of barbarians from the North, much as the Roman Empire finally succumbed to the Germanic invasions. These invaders were the early Greeks, and this period is usually called the Homeric Age, because so many of its features are reflected in the Homeric poems, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
    <p>The times were rude, and social life was primitive. War and piracy were ordinary pursuits. The people grouped themselves around powerful chieftains for protection, but marauding bands were common, which killed, burned, and plundered. Personal valor and prowess in battle were of supreme importance, not only for one&#x27;s own safety, but for the safety and freedom of his friends and family as well. Accordingly, the greatest virtue, and the one held in highest esteem, was bravery in war.</p>
    <p>For our picture of the culture of this period we are dependent upon the Homeric poems. In them we see how expeditions were made by the Greeks against their enemies, whom they considered at all times as legitimate objects of plunder. Usually such expeditions were under one of the many petty Homeric &quot;kings.&quot; Of these there were a great number; and there was no unity and no central authority in Homeric Greece any more than there were in the later historical period.</p>
    <p>According to the tradition, the expedition against Troy was undertaken by the whole of Greece, united under the leadership of Agamemnon. Some think that this tradition rests upon an ultimate basis of fact; but this may be merely an idealistic touch, expressing an earnest hope of the poet, that the various Greek tribes may reconcile their differences and stop warring on each other long enough to make war upon the common foe, the barbarians, as represented by the non-Greek inhabitants of Asia Minor. In the Homeric poems we find that although Agamemnon was commander in chief of the allied Greek military expedition, the various contingents were led by their own commanders, most of whom were their kings, apparently quite independent of Aga<span class="page-break" id="p.xxxiii">[pg. xxxiii]</span>memnon when at home, and semi-independent of him during the expedition. The most important of these secondary leaders were: Nestor of Pylus, the oldest man in the world; Agamemnon&#x27;s brother, Menelaus, the wronged husband of Helen; the young, daring, generous, and impetuous Achilles of Phthia; the mighty Diomedes of Argos, who fought with the very gods themselves; the wily Odysseus (Ulysses) of Ithaca, who wandered for ten years after the fall of Troy before he arrived safe at home and saw once more his wife, the faithful Penelope; the huge and brutal Telamonian Ajax of Salamis; the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus of Locris;</p>

    <p>Teucer, the Archer, brother of Telamonian Ajax; and Idomeneus of Crete, the far-famed isle of a hundred cities.</p>
    <p>On the Trojan side the most important characters are: Hector, eldest son of Priam and commander-in-chief of the Trojan forces; the aged Priam, King of Troy; Hecuba, his wife; Andromache, wife of Hector; Paris, brother of Hector and the one who had brought on the war by stealing Helen; Glaucus and Sarpedon, princes of Lycia, whose beautiful and unselfish friendship is only matched by that of Achilles and Patroclus on the Greek side.</p>
    <p>The divinities take an active part in the conflict, some siding with the Greeks, the others with the Trojans. Zeus, who stands <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxiv">[pg. xxxiv]</span> at the head of the gods, as father and king of gods and men, seems inclined to be neutral. Hera his wife, queen of the gods, cherishes an implacable hatred against the Trojans, as does Athena, his daughter, goddess of war, wisdom, and the arts. Poseidon, brother of Zeus, the mighty god of the sea, is also on the side of the Greeks, and loses no opportunity to help them. On the Trojan side were Apollo, god of light, who wards off darkness and evil, patron of music, poetry and healing; Artemis, his sister, a divinity of the moonlight, goddess of the woods and wild animals, and patroness of the chase; Leto, their mother; Aphrodite, born of the white sea-foam, goddess of love and beauty, who had assisted Paris in obtaining Helen; Hephaestus, the lame god of fire, patron of all useful mechanical arts and the working of metals; and the river-god Scamander, a stream near Troy.</p>
    <p>The gods are distinctly human in their characteristics and attributes, with human appetites and passions. They differ from men primarily in being more powerful and in being immortal. They enjoy a good dinner, where they feast on nectar and ambrosia; they love and hate, are envious and jealous, but on the whole live a happier and serener life than mortals.</p>
    <p>In translating Homer, it would be well to hold in mind the four essential characteristics of his poetry as enumerated by Matthew Arnold: <span>Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble in his manner.</span></p>
    <p>For a good characterization of the Homeric poems, from the point of view of literary art, one should by all means read Andrew Lang&#x27;s Essay, <em>Homer and the Study of Greek</em>, from which the following is taken.</p> 
    <span>
        <span>
            <p>Homer is a poet for all ages, all races, and all moods. To the Greeks the epics were not only the best of romances, the richest of poetry; not only their oldest documents about their own history - they were also their Bible, their treasury of religious traditions and moral teaching. With the Bible and Shakespeare, the Homeric poems are the best training for life. There is no good quality that they lack: manliness, courage, reverence for old age and the hospitable hearth; justice, piety, pity, a <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxv">[pg. xxxv]</span> brave attitude toward life and death, are all conspicuous in Homer. He has to write of battles; and he delights in the joy of battle, and in all the movements of war. Yet he delights not less, but more, in peace: in prosperous cities, hearths secure, in the tender beauty of children, in the love of wedded wives, in the frank nobility of maidens, in the beauty of earth and sky and sea and seaward murmuring river, in sun and snow, frost and mist and rain, in the whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and pine tree.</p>
            <p>Living in an age when every man was a warrior, where every city might know the worst of sack and fire, where the noblest ladies
            <span>
                <h3>STOREROOM IN THE PALACE AT GNOSSUS</h3>
            </span>
            might be led away for slaves, to light the fire and make the bed of a foreign master, Homer inevitably regards life as a battle. To each man on earth comes &#x27;the wicked day of destiny,&#x27; as Malory unconsciously translates it, and each man must face it hardily as he may.</p>
            <p>Homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and honor. His heart is with the brave of either side — with Glaucus and Sarpedon of Lycia no less than with Achilles and Patroclus. &#x27;Ah friend,&#x27; cries Sarpedon, &#x27;if once escaped from this battle we were for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I myself fight <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxvi">[pg. xxxvi]</span> now in the foremost ranks, nor would I urge thee into the wars that give renown; but now - for assuredly ten thousand fates of death on every side beset us, and these may no man shun, nor avoid forward let us go, whether we are to give glory or to win it.&#x27; And forth they go, to give and take renown and death, all the shields and helmets of Lycia shining behind them, through the dust of battle, the singing of arrows, the hurtling of spears, the rain of stones from the Locrian slings. And shields are smitten, and chariot-horses run wild, with no man to drive them, and Sarpedon drags down a portion of the Achaean battlement, and Aias leaps into the trench with his deadly spear, and the whole battle shifts and shines beneath the sun. Yet he who sings of the war, and sees it with his sightless eyes, sees also the Trojan women working at the loom, cheating their anxious hearts with broidery work of gold and scarlet, or raising the song to Athena, or heating the bath for Hector, who never again may pass within the gates of Troy. He sees the poor weaving woman, weighing the wool, that she may not cheat her employers, and yet may win bread for her children. He sees the children, the golden head of Astyanax, his shrinking from the splendor of the hero&#x27;s helm. He sees the child Odysseus, going with his father through the orchard, and choosing out some apple trees &#x27;for his very own.&#x27; It is in the mouth of the ruthless Achilles, the fatal, the fated, the swift-footed hero of the hands of death, that Homer places the tenderest of his similes. &#x27;Wherefore weepest thou, Patroclus, like a fond little maid that runs by her mother&#x27;s side, praying her mother to take her up, snatching at her gown, and hindering her as she walks, and tearfully looking at her till her mother takes her up? - Like her, Patroclus, dost thou fondly weep.&#x27;... Such are the moods of Homer, so full of love of life and all things living, so rich in all human sympathies, so readily moved when the great hound Argus welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but the hound knew him, and died in that welcome. With all this love of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of armor, of implement of art; on the divers-colored gold work of the shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the forging of <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxvii">[pg. xxxvii]</span> iron, on the rose-tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on cooking and eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and their ways, on fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths where fair maidens lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered isles with good harbors and rich land, on plowing, mowing, and sowing, on the furniture of houses, on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is laid, - with all this delight in the real, Homer is the most romantic of poets. He walks with the surest foot in the
            darkling realm of dread Persephone, beneath
            the poplars of the last beach of Ocean. He has
            heard the siren&#x27;s music, and the song of Circe,
            chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the
            golden shuttle through the loom of gold. He
            enters the cave of the man-eater; he knows
            the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; in the
            summer of the North he has looked, from the
            fiord of the Laestrygons, on the midnight sun.
            He has dwelt on the floating isle of Aeolus,
            with its wall of bronze unbroken, and has sailed
            on those Phaeacian barks that need no help
            of helm or oar, that fear no stress either of
            wind or tide, that come and go and return,
            obedient to a thought and silent as a dream.
            He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters
            of wells and woods, and of sacred streams. He
            is the second-sighted man, and beholds the
            shroud that wraps the living who are doomed, and the mystic
            dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed. He has walked in
            the garden closes of Phaeacia and looked on the face of gods who
            fare thither and watch the weaving of the dance. He has eaten
            the honey-sweet fruit of the Lotus, and from the hand of Helen
            he brings us that Egyptian Nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of
            the mind. His real world is as real as that of Henry V., his enchanted
            isles are charmed with the magic of the Tempest. His
            young wooers are as insolent as Claudio, as flushed with youth;
            his beggar-men are brethren of Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is
            <span>

            sister to Rosalind, with a different charm of stately purity in love. His enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is very beauty; she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and her repentance is without remorse. His Achilles is youth itself, glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and loving, and conscious of its doom. Homer, in truth, is to be matched only by Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not the occasional willfulness, freakishness, and modish obscurity. He is a poet all of gold, universal as humanity, simple as childhood, musical now as the flow of his own rivers, now as the heavy plunging wave of his own ocean.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>
    <h3>1</h3>
    <p><span>Vocabulary.</span> - One of the things most important in learning any language so as to be able to read it with profit and pleasure is to acquire a fair-sized vocabulary. In doing this, one should learn thoroughly the words that are used most. For this purpose there is a highly practical little book, <em>Homeric Vocabularies</em>, Owen and Goodspeed, published by the University of Chicago Press. The most common Homeric words are arranged in it in groups, according to frequency of occurrence. A copy of this book should be in the hands of every student who wishes to lighten his work in learning to read and enjoy Homer.</p>
    <p><span>Forms of the Greek Verb.</span> - In learning the Greek verb, the most difficult part of Greek grammar, it is highly important to know which forms are most essential. The following material, with the two tables, compiled by Professor Robbins, will indicate where the stress of work should come. These tables will be found valuable, not only for Homeric Greek, but for other Greek as well. By emphasizing strongly the forms which are most common, it will be found that the work will be materially lightened, and the Greek verb will not be found at all formidable.</p>
    <p>&quot;Table I tabulates the result of counting the verb forms found on ten pages each of Homer, Euripides, Herodotus, Demosthenes,</p>
    <span class="page-break" id="p.xxxix">[pg. xxxix]</span>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>and Plato, and on twenty of Xenophon (ten each from the <em>Anabasis</em> and the <em>Memorabilia</em>). In most cases the pages of the Oxford Classical Texts or the Bibliotheca Teubneriana have been made the unit, and for the present purpose the variation in the amount of Greek on the page need cause no concern. It may be remarked, also, that first and second perfects have been counted together because they are best taught together, and that the present participle of εἰμί has been included among the thematic present participles.<span class="tooltip" id="note-1"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[1]</sup><span class="tooltip-text">&quot;Another liberty which I have taken is to disregard perfects of the -μι form, reckoning all perfects together. Aorists like ἔβην are counted as -μι forms.&quot;</span></span></p>
    <p>&quot;The revelations of Table I make clear a few points that have a definite bearing on the teaching of Greek. In the first place, it shows that a large majority of the verbs one meets in reading Greek are confined to a small group of forms. Table II will make this clearer; it will then appear that nine or ten forms make up over a half, and twenty-four forms three-quarters, of the verbs in average Greek. Is it not right that we should first concern ourselves with teaching these forms? Of course, one must not guide himself entirely by these, or any similar, statistics; often it is advantageous to teach a whole group together, even though this involves the introduction of certain rather rare forms together with others that are commoner. On the other hand, here we have a definite, practical ground for demanding that certain forms be introduced very early.</p>
    <p>&quot;Among these the present active participle deserves special mention. The statistics show the high frequency of its occurrence, and indeed few sentences, save the most elementary, can be mastered without a knowledge of it. Furthermore, its inflection can easily be made an introduction to both the first and third declensions, and one should not readily pass by an opportunity to kill three birds with one stone.</p>
    <p>&quot;The apparently high frequency of the present and imperfect indicative and the present infinitive of -μι verbs is due not so much to ἵστημι, τίθημι, δίδωμι, and δείκνυμι as to the constant</p>

    <h3>HOMERIC GREEK</h3>
    <p>occurrence of forms of <i class="greek">εἰμί</i> and <i class="greek">φημί</i> (<i class="greek">ἐστί</i>, <i class="greek">εἰσί</i>, <i class="greek">ἦν</i>, <i class="greek">ἦσαν</i>, <i class="greek">εἶναι</i>, <i class="greek">ἔφη</i>). These particular forms are entitled to an early hearing in the classroom and are probably best taught separately, as indeed they usually are, the other athematic verbs being postponed.</p>
    <p>&quot;In Table II there have been set down the twenty-four forms which occur most frequently, with the percentage of their occurrence in ordinary Greek.</p>
    <p>&quot;From Table II, which is based upon Table I and is really a summary of the most important facts to be gleaned from Table I, one might conclude that the student should as soon as possible be put in command of the present, imperfect, first and second aorist, perfect, and future indicative, the present and first and second aorist, infinitive and participle, at least the active present optative, subjunctive, and imperative, <i class="greek">εἰμί</i> in full, and some forms of <i class="greek">φημί</i>; with these mastered, he will have to depend on the teacher or notes in the textbook for only a quarter of the verb forms he sees, and of course this proportion will be cut down as he progresses.&quot;</p>

To the ancient Greeks the realm of Hades was not primarily a place of punishment, of tortures, and of horrors, as the Christian Hell, but was a faint and cheerless copy of the upper world, and was the abode of all departed spirits of the dead.

<p><span><span>τεῦχε</span></span> = <i>ἔτευχε</i> : <a class="reference" href="#n837837">837</a>. In order for the soul of the deceased to obtain rest, it was necessary that the body be buried, or cremated, with the proper funeral rites. If the enemy gained possession of his foe&#x27;s body, as a mark of the worst he could do, he might give it over to the dogs and birds to devour. This heightened the pathos of the poet&#x27;s theme. The scene on the opposite page shows how bitterly the old Greeks and Trojans fought for the bodies of the slain. Achilles, who has been shot through the heel by Paris, lies dead in the midst of the fray. The Trojans have pounced upon his body, eager to drag it within their own lines. Glaucus, one of their number, while attempting to tie a thong to the foot of Achilles, falls mortally wounded by Ajax, who is stoutly defending the corpse. Other Trojans, including Paris, Aeneas, Laodocus, and Echippus, have joined in the battle.</p>

            <p>On the first seven verses, read <a class="reference" href="#n6363">63</a> (end), and compare Hermann Grimm: &quot;These first verses are like the tones of a funeral march rising to a sky shrouded with gloomy clouds. A series of verses which like heralds announce the whole poem. A gloomy cloud gathers over the Greeks. The field is covered with the corpses of fallen heroes. Dogs and vultures tear the bodies of the slain. The most powerful of men and the mightiest mortal descendant of Zeus quarrel. Zeus has determined the destruction of the people. All this in a single sentence which closes with <i>Ἀχιλλεύς</i>.”</p>
            <p>With fine poetic insight Homer begins his story in the very middle with a thrilling situation, and allows the background with what has gone before to unfold itself gradually, as it is needed, in the course of his narrative.</p>
            <p>In order to create a situation which would inevitably bring on a quarrel so far-reaching in its consequences, it is not enough for merely human factors and natural causes to operate, but some divinity must motivate the action. This gives the poet a wider range for his creative imagination, and makes anything possible.</p>

<p>The sceptre was a symbol of authority. Of course it was of gold if it is to appear decently in epic. The whole atmosphere of a poem of this kind is supramundane. Its leading characters are divine or semi-divine, and their equipment must all be of more precious material than that which suffices for ordinary mortals. Thus Apollo has a golden sword. Several of the warriors before Troy have golden armor, and the gods sit on golden thrones which rest upon the golden pavements of their palaces in Olympus. In the same way the new Jerusalem has streets of gold and gates of pearl.</p><p></p>

            <p>To get the full effect of this situation, it must be remembered that the girl had been captured by the marauding Greeks, on a pillaging expedition near Troy, and in the distribution of the booty she had fallen to the lot of Agamemnon, whose personal property she now is. So the old priest has little difficulty in winning over &quot;all the other Achaeans,&quot; who vociferously assent to his proposition; but Agamemnon, the only one who has anything to lose by the transaction, does not prove to be so easy. Apparently he was not yet ready to return a choice prize in exchange for a few pieces of gold and silver, or some old pots and pans and the paltry prayers of a pious priest. The piety of the other Greeks and their reverence for the priest are placed in marked contrast to the action of Agamemnon, who alone is wicked, and obstinately so. His course is further robbed of any possible redeeming feature by the fact that he is not only an ungodly sinner, but is actually rude and ill-mannered to the priest. In requital for all this, as we shall learn in the sequel, the people are the chief sufferers, who perish in heaps, while Agamemnon escapes the plague. This is really an artistic blemish and offends one&#x27;s sense of poetic justice. But it is necessary for the later development of the plot that the king be preserved alive, and besides throughout all history &quot;when the king sins the people suffer.&quot; For an illuminating parallel, read 2 Sam. 24 inter alia.</p>
            <p>Agamemnon is too angry to consider any of the points urged by the priest, and does not even thank him for his prayer for the success of the expedition and a safe journey homeward (vss. 18-19), but takes that all for granted (see vs. 30, next lesson). He respects neither god nor priest, and prefers the girl to the ransom. In addressing the priest curtly as <i>γέρον</i>, old man, he disregards his appeal as a representative of the god.</p>

            <p>&quot;You depend upon your insignia (<i>σκῆπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοῖο</i>) as priest to protect you. Small help will they be if you continue to anger me.”</p>
            <p>&quot;The girl shall never return to you, but she shall be a drudge and a menial all her days, to contribute to my comfort and to my good pleasure.&quot; To make the lot of the captive still more bitter, she must endure all this in a far-away land in the midst of strangers, who might not always be sympathetic. The illustration on the preceding page shows the entrance to the fortified enclosure containing Agamemnon&#x27;s palace, where he intended the daughter of the priest to serve him.</p>
            <p>It is characteristic of the poet&#x27;s art that Agamemnon is represented as leaving to the imagination just what dire form his brutality may take, although his threat perhaps contains an intimation that if the old priest does not depart instanter, he may pay for his temerity with his life. Having no good arguments or adequate reasons to offer, Agamemnon resorts to vile abuse to close the discussion and get rid of his unwelcome visitor. Homer represents the brutality of Agamemnon in as glaring a light as possible, to prepare the way for the righteous indignation of the god and the fearful consequences which the Greek hosts are to suffer for the king&#x27;s rash impiety.</p>

The part the old priest took in building the temple may have involved no more work than the superintending of the job, while ordinary people performed the labor. ·<i>τοι [σύ]</i>: dat. sing., for thee. <i>Σμινθεῦ</i>: as in vs. 37 the priest calls upon the god by his title of <i>ἀργυρότοξος</i>, thereby intimating that he should bring along his bow, so here he evidently has a purpose in mind by calling upon him by his title of Smintheus, mouse god. For the old Greeks, probably without knowing the scientific basis, recognized the connection of mice with plagues. (Compare the spread of the bubonic plague by means of rats.) Thus Apollo with his mice could bring a deadly plague upon whomsoever he chose. The Philistines also, who are to be connected with the early Greek and Trojan civilizations through Crete, their former home, associated mice with plagues. &quot;And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumours, even Ashdod and the coasts <span class="page-break" id="p.49">[pg. 49]</span>
      thereof.... So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. And the men that died not were smitten with the tumours : and the cry of the city went up to heaven. And the Philistines called for the priests and diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of Jehovah? Tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering. Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumours and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. Wherefore you shall make images of your tumours and of the mice that mar the land.&quot;</p>
      <p>Another example of this sort is to be found in the account of the destruction of the hosts of Sennacherib, which was doubtless due to a plague of some sort. According to the Biblical narrative, “It came to pass that night that the angel of Jehovah went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.&quot; Herodotus, the early Greek historian, who traveled in Egypt some two hundred and fifty years later, gives an account of this same event, but associates the destruction with mice. However, in this two hundred and fifty years the mice have risen from ordinary pest carriers till in the narrative of Herodotus they assume an active and intelligent part in coöperation with the Egyptian armies against the common foe. By a night attack they fall upon their unwary enemies, and while the army slept they gnawed their bow strings and shield straps, so that in the morning, finding their armor useless, the hosts flee in terror, and countless numbers of them perish in the rout that follows.</p>

    <p>The burden of the priest&#x27;s prayer (vss. 37-42) is: &quot;I have placed you under great obligations; so you ought to do this little favor for me.&quot; In a sacrifice of this kind the priest burned choice bits of the animal to the god as a banquet to him. The god obtained this as it came up to him in the smoke that rose to heaven (cf. Gen. viii, 20-21, etc.).</p>
<p><span><span>μηρία</span></span> (vs. 40) were the thigh-pieces, the bones with the marrow and some meat. The marrow of the bones was looked upon as a special delicacy. Observe how specific the priest is in enumerating the favors he has conferred upon his god. &quot;I have built for you a shrine, for your pleasure, and I have served to you the best thigh-pieces I could get, together with the bones and marrow, and I swear that they had plenty of fat on them too.&quot;</p>
    <p>In vss. 39-42 observe the rhyming effect produced by the repetition of the οι sound in these verses, which brings these words (<i>τοι, τοι, μοι</i>, <i>Δαναοί</i>) into special prominence: &quot;If I have done thy wish for thee, then thou shouldst do my wish for me.&quot; The priest has done so many favors for the god that now the god ought to do something for the priest, and avenge his wrongs by slaying the Danaans. If we were in the realm of reason instead of poetry, with its artistic requirements and its necessities for the furtherance of the plot, we might ask why the old man does not request the god to punish Agamemnon directly, which would have been a much easier task, and might have been expected to produce the desired results with more certainty.</p>

      <p><i>βῆ = ἔβη [βαίνω]</i>, set out. The gods live on Olympus, a high mountain in northern Thessaly, just as the favorite home of Jehovah for a long time was on Mt. Sinai, although he might frequent any high mountain, as Carmel, Lebanon, or Tabor. In a very real sense heaven lay about the human race in its infancy, in that it was supposed to be quite near, so near in fact that if one would shout loud enough his god(s) could hear him. Thus when one prayed, he commonly cried out with a loud voice. &quot;Then stood upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Jehovah their god.&quot; It was thought quite possible to erect a structure high enough that one might step out of it right into heaven. &quot;And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime for mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven.” – <i>Οὐλύμποιο</i>, <a class="reference" href="#n11681168">1168</a>, <a class="reference" href="#n571571">571</a>.</p>
      <p>Any mountain whose summit was high enough, such as Sinai or Olympus, might thus furnish a convenient place for the fixed abode of the gods, where they might build their homes and have some of the comforts of family life.</p>
<p><span><span>κῆρ</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#n10141014">1014</a>. It was not thought improper for gods to show anger (<i>χωόμενος</i>). &quot;And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.&quot; <i>βῆ κατ᾿ Οὐλύμποιο (Ολύμποιο, 571) καρήνων</i>: of course if the gods lived in heaven, they must come down to earth in order to work their will</p>

      <p>This passage gives accurately the ordinary course of such plagues, where the poet, perhaps without realizing it, follows closely the results of modern medical science, in establishing the fact that such pestilences usually attack animals first, and from these the contagion would spread among human beings. During this whole procedure the god must be thought of as seated on some high point of vantage, perhaps a convenient cloud, or a hill in the neighborhood. He is of course invisible to the suffering Greeks, who perhaps have not as yet suspected the real cause of their afflictions. The clang of his bow might easily be mistaken for thunder. To us moderns it seems rather undignified, not to say bathos, to see the god so highly wrought up in his anger, coming down from Olympus with all the attributes of terror, ready to visit destruction upon the Greeks for their insult (through Agamemnon) to his priest, seat himself and turn his implements of death upon the mules and dogs of the camp, who had done him no wrong. This seems to be due to the fusion of two conceptions: 1) the poetic description of the wrath of the revengeful god, preparing to destroy those who have insulted his priest, and 2) the actual description of the usual course of a plague.</p>

      <p><span><span>βάλλ&#x27;</span></span> is emphatic by position, by the following pause, by the prolonged sound of the trilled <i>λλ</i> (making it onomatopoetic), and by meaning (imperfect). The imperfect represents a series of repeated actions. Observe how vividly the poet presents to the eye the great number of deaths due to the arrows of the god. We can see the funeral pyres, with their heaps of corpses, burning on every side.</p>
      <p>On this whole passage, compare what Lessing says in the Laocoön, when discussing some of the fundamental differences between the art of the painter and that of the poet. <span><span>The picture of the plague. What do we see on the canvas? Dead bodies, the flame of funeral pyres, the dying busied with the dead, the angry god upon a cloud discharging his arrows. The profuse wealth of the picture becomes poverty in the poet. Now let us turn to Homer himself. The poet here is as far beyond the painter as life is better than a picture. Wrathful, with bow and quiver, Apollo descends from the Olympian towers. I not only see him, but hear him. At every step the arrows rattle on the shoulders of the angry god. He enters among the host like the night. Now he seats himself over against the ships, and with a terrible clang of the silver bow sends his first shaft against the mules and dogs. Next he turns his poisoned (deadly) darts upon the warriors themselves, and unceasing blaze on every side the corpse-laden pyres. It is impossible to translate into any other language the musical painting heard in the poet&#x27;s words.</span> <span id="nGRC">Probably based on the English translation by Helen Zimmern of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Laokoon https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uva.x030340370?urlappend=%3Bseq=109 For the German original: https://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/lessing/laokoon/laok131.html </span></span></p>
      <p>The stage is now all set for the introduction of the hero, the divine Achilles, who henceforth plays a prominent part, and is never wholly lost sight of for the rest of the poem.</p>

<p><span><span>ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε Ἥρη</span></span>: Achilles has an idea, which is represented by the poet as an inspiration from heaven. Such was a common belief regarding any plan which later developments showed to be fraught with more than ordinary consequences, but this of course could only be known after the events had transpired. &quot;Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. And my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people.&quot; &quot;And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put into my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.&quot; &quot;And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#x27;s son, to betray him....&quot;</p>
      <p>It is just as well not to ask why Agamemnon, the leader of the forces, who apparently was not yet aware of the cause of the plague, did not summon this assembly. The poet explains it by saying that Hera was responsible, and he thus frees Achilles from any blame in the matter. Achilles is brought before us in a few verses as a chivalrous and generous-hearted warrior, and is contrasted with the selfish, grasping, and brutal Agamemnon. The poet does all this by indirection, with a very few words, yet so skillfully that henceforth the sympathies of the audience are with the hero.</p>
    </span></span>
    

     <section class="textpart" id="div-55">
<p><span><span>λευκώλενος</span></span>: the poet keenly senses the features of his objects which are distinctive and characteristic, and which visualize them best for his hearers. Thus when he says white-armed (<i>λευκώλενος</i>) Hera, one cannot <span class="page-break" id="p.59">[pg. 59]</span> help seeing a beautiful and stately queen, with shining white arms. In the same way, the ships are swift (vs. 12), and hollow (vs. 26), Achilles swift-footed (vs. 58), Apollo a sharp-shooter (vss. 14, 21), and is a god with a silver bow (vs. 37), the Achaeans are well-greaved (vs. 17), the ransoms shining (vs. 23), the sea loud-resounding (vs. 34), Leto flowinghaired (vs. 36), the thigh-pieces of bulls and goats fat (vs. 40), Apollo&#x27;s quiver covered at both ends (vs. 45), his bow silver (vs. 49, cf. vs. 37), his arrows biting (vs. 51), and the dogs are swift as a silvery flash (vs. 50).</p>

But then Hera is to blame (read the note on vs. 55). Thus the poet gives good and sufficient grounds for the righteous indignation of Agamemnon, and at the same time prevents the sympathies of his audience from being alienated from the hero.</p>

<p>The doubtful tone here shows that Achilles does not feel at all certain that they will be successful in their appeal to the free-shooter. Of course if the god has been offended, he must first be appeased before he will listen to their prayer or accept their offering, &quot;for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto Jehovah.&quot; &quot;Hear, O earth: behold I will bring evil upon this people ..., because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.&quot; &quot;To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.&quot; But if they once succeeded in allaying the hot wrath of their god, the best way to win favor with him was to give him a good dinner of nice roast lamb or kid. &quot;And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted; who did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?&quot; &quot;And when thou preparest a bullock for the sacrifice, in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto Jehovah: then shall he bring with a bullock a food offering of three tenths of an ephah of flour, mingled with half an hin of oil.&quot; Of course the animals offered in sacrifice must be of the choicest, fat and sleek, with no blemish or disease whatsoever.</p>      <p>Seeing that everything is going to ruin, Achilles suggests to Agamemnon, commander in chief of the allied expedition, that they attempt to save at least the lives of those remaining. The only way he sees of doing this is to abandon the undertaking and return home. He suggests further that they consult some holy man of God, who may tell them what the trouble is and help them to avert the anger of the divinity from those who are still alive.</p><p>It is characteristic of the psychology of primitive peoples to see in the operations of nature the direct action of their gods, beings created in their own image, with feelings and passions like unto their own. If good fortune befell a people it was a mark of the special favor of their divinity; if evil came it was a sign of his displeasure, and some one had sinned, whom the god was seeking to punish. &quot;And Nathan said to David,... Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of Jehovah, to do evil in his sight? Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. ... <span class="page-break" id="p.65">[pg. 65]</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.&quot; &quot;Then there was a famine in the days of David, three years, year after year; and David inquired of Jehovah. And Jehovah answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.&quot; &quot;But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly. ... Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.&quot; &quot;So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim. ... And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah. ... And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have taken even of the accursed thing.... Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed. Neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you.&quot; Cf. Tennyson, The Victim.</p>

<p>Although not called upon by name, Calchas here comes dramatically forward, not from any egotism, but from a proper selfevaluation. Homer&#x27;s heroes seem to have had little of that mock modesty, humility, and self-depreciation in vogue to-day, which as found in our own modern life seems to be primarily of Semitic ancestry. &quot;And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto Jehovah, which am but dust and ashes.&quot; &quot;How then can man be just with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight: how much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man which is a worm!&quot; &quot;But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.&quot;</p>

And he spake with trees, from the cedar that is in <span class="page-break" id="p.66">[pg. 66]</span> Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also with beasts and birds and creeping things and with fishes.&quot;</p>

    <p>Optional. At this point a thorough review of all the preceding Homer should be taken; all the paradigms of all the nouns should be memorized; the irregular adjectives should now be learned, and a review taken of all the others; and the verb λύω in all its forms, including infinitives and participles, should be mastered before attempting to read further. A good plan to fix both forms and vocabulary is to take each word of the Iliad as it appears in the text, locate the form, and give the meaning of the word according to the model found in the vocabulary at the end of this book. This should be done orally for these verses, and this should be followed by a comprehensive written examination. A good drill on these will materially lighten the following work.</p>

Such a difficult undertaking as the guiding of the ships for so great a distance, through strange seas, could only be accomplished by the direct assistance of the god, just as the Israelites were guided by Jehovah in their long and difficult journey to Palestine. A soothsayer regularly accompanied all ancient military expeditions, to interpret the will of the gods, and to guide the people aright. In many cases they doubtless had superior knowledge, which would help to explain their hold on the masses. &quot;Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.&quot; &quot;And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face.&quot; &quot;And Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them, ...

In fact this was the only proper course for him to pursue, and was thought of as perfectly natural by all concerned. Owing to later developments, Agamemnon would be perfectly justified in suspecting a collusion between him and Achilles.</p><p>Observe the spondaic ending, which brings this verse, and particularly the last word, into strong prominence, as being of more than ordinary importance.

    <h3>A SILVER COIN OF SYRACUSE</h3>

<p>χόλος, κότος: the first of hot resentment, which may pass, the second of a deepseated grudge, which calculates upon revenge.</p>
</section>
    <section class="textpart" id="div-83"><p><span><span>ἐν στήθεσσιν ἑοῖσι</span></span>: the possessive pronoun is emphatic, to indicate that he keeps it absolutely secret and bides his time for revenge. στήθεσσι: plural, to individualize the various parts of the chest. — σύ: everything now depends upon you. – φράσαι : imperative.</p>
      <p>It has always been dangerous to arouse the wrath of a king or of a god; for even though they did not exact vengeance immediately they would hold the grudge, sometimes even to the third and fourth generation of the children of the sinner, till they had obtained full satisfaction. Then, too, when once their wrath was kindled, they were notoriously and recklessly cruel in revenging themselves. &quot;The wrath of a king is as messengers of death, but a wise man will pacify it.&quot; &quot;The king&#x27;s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew upon the grass.&quot; &quot;Kiss the son (i.e. the king), lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little.&quot; &quot;And when the people complained it displeased Jehovah : <span class="page-break" id="p.74">[pg. 74]</span> and Jehovah heard it: and his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.&quot;</p>
      <p>The seer really had more power than Agamemnon, who is compelled to yield to him, as we learn in the sequel; but he does not wish to expose himself unnecessarily either to any rashness on the part of the king in his hot wrath nor to his plotting afterward, should he cherish a grudge.</p></section>

The <i>οὐ</i> of this verse repeats the <i>οὐ</i> of vs. 86, for the sake of clearness after the long intervening parenthetic clause. This verse is another good example of epic fullness of expression, a form of pleonasm, used to make the statement more emphatic and impressive.</p>

     <section class="textpart" id="div-90">
<p>Achilles is specific in naming Agamemnon, where the more prudent and cautious Calchas had been content to use general terms in describing him, without taking the risk of calling him by name.</p>
</section>
    <span class="tooltip" id="note-91"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[91]</sup><span class="tooltip-text"><p>This is of course not egotism on the part of Agamemnon (cf. note on vs. 68 ff.), but merely a naïve recognition of his own worth. He was not without a certain amount of competition in this matter, however, as Achilles modestly claims this honor (of being <i>ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν</i>) for himself (vs. 244); and, for the purposes of the poet, various leaders of the Greeks might on differing occasions be considered worthy to bear this title. It is part of the superlative and hyperbolic language of epic, cf. the note to vs. 15, § 90, and to vs. 70, § 176.</p>
      <p>With these words Achilles takes the final step which must provoke Agamemnon beyond all measure. Carried away by his own generous enthusiasm in protecting the defenseless, he sets himself up as the equal of his commander in chief, and thus leads inevitably onward to the bitter quarrel which ensues.</p>
      <p>Achilles swears by the patron god of Calchas himself that no harm shall befall the prophet, and that he is willing to risk his own life in his defense, even though he accuse Agamemnon, whose violent and reckless wrath was a matter of common knowledge. Such a promise was naturally to be expected from Achilles&#x27; impetuously generous character. With this assurance the prophet is ready to disclose the will of the god and the cause of all their woe.</p>
      <p>It was once a matter of common belief that if any one swore by a god and then proved false to his oath, the divinity involved would punish him with all due severity. For that reason an oath was considered as binding by those who would have no hesitation in breaking their word. There is a peculiar fitness in swearing by Apollo here, not only <span class="page-break" id="p.77">[pg. 77]</span> as the patron god of Calchas, but he is destroying the Greeks with his arrows, and Achilles would be inviting a special dispensation of his wrath upon himself should he fail to keep his vow. &quot;And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.&quot; &quot;If a man vow a vow unto Jehovah, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.&quot; &quot;Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.&quot; &quot;Thou shalt not swear falsely by the name of Jehovah thy God; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that sweareth falsely by his name.&quot; &quot;Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent.&quot;</p>
      <p>When Agamemnon claims to be &quot;far the best of the Achaeans,&quot; he uses &quot;best&quot; in the Irish sense, of being able to overcome any one there in a fair fight.</p></span></span>
     <section class="textpart" id="div-92">
<p><span><span>θάρσησε</span></span>: took courage: inceptive aorist, <a class="reference" href="#n10811081">1081</a>.</p>

<p><span><span>ἀρητῆρος</span></span>: emphatic by position, and placed in strict contrast with <i>εὐχωλῆς</i>, as both occupy the same position in the verse. &quot;Perhaps you thought it was a vow or a hecatomb, but no, it was a priest.&quot; Observe how the seer waits till the last possible moment in his sentence before speaking the name of Agamemnon, which might seem to indicate his fear of him, but at the same time would bring this word into special prominence.</p>
</section>
     <section class="textpart" id="div-94-95">
<p>The prophet first makes the general statement that the priest was insulted, and follows this by citing two specific features.</p>

     <section class="textpart" id="div-96">
<p><span><span>τούνεκ&#x27; (α)</span></span> sums up the preceding and brings it out prominently, so that there can be no mistaking what the real cause of the trouble is. It has always been dangerous to insult a holy man of God. &quot;And Elisha went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare in pieces forty and two children of them.&quot;</p>

<p><span><span>Δαναοῖσιν</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#n997997">997</a>.</p>
<p><span><span>ὅ γε</span></span> resumes the subject, Apollo, with emphasis. 96-97: perhaps the rhyme at the end of these two verses is intentional, to bring these two words into full relief and sharp contrast with each other.</p>
</section>
     <section class="textpart" id="div-98">
<p>The subject of <i>δόμεναι</i> may be the Greeks, but more likely it is intended to refer to Agamemnon, and would thus be omitted on purpose by the priest, who is afraid of his anger, in spite of the assurance of Achilles.</p>
<p><span><span>ἑλικώπιδα</span></span>: “ bright-eyes,&quot; is another of those speaking epithets which brings the object vividly before the mind, and helps to explain Agamemnon&#x27;s infatuation for the girl with her flashing eyes, that sparkled with the fullness of rippling laughter.</p>
</section>
     <section class="textpart" id="div-97-98">
<p><span><span>πρὶν ... πρίν</span></span>: he will not sooner drive off pestilence... till (we) give back....</p>
<p><span><span>ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον</span></span>: “ without money and without price.&quot; Tautology for the sake of emphasis. Restoration and <span class="page-break" id="p.80">[pg. 80]</span> reparation must be made before the god will consider any peace terms.</p>
</section>
    <span class="tooltip" id="note-100"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[100]</sup><span class="tooltip-text"><p><span><span>ἐς Χρύσην</span></span>: into Chrysa, the town, not to Chryses, the priest. Calchas is evidently not willing to guarantee that they will succeed in appeasing the god by following his prescription, as the action of the divinity is dependent upon his own arbitrary free will, and hence uncertain. This type of statement has the further advantage of leaving a loophole of escape for the priest, who would thus preserve inviolate his reputation for infallibility. Theoretically it should be possible to persuade the god, as Homer says in another place (where an old friend of Achilles is trying to induce him to forego his anger against Agamemnon): &quot;Therefore, Achilles, rule thy high spirit; neither doth it befit thee to have a ruthless heart. Nay, even the very gods can bend, and theirs withal is loftier majesty and honor and might. Their hearts by incense and reverent vows and drink-offerings and burnt offerings men turn with prayer, so oft as any transgresseth and doeth sin.&quot; <i>πεπίθοιμεν</i> : <a class="reference" href="#n11051105">1105</a>.</p>
      <p>This speech of Calchas is a fine example of good oratory. First, he disabuses the minds of his hearers of their prepossessions (they thought the god might be offended because of some vow unfulfilled, or of some hecatomb unoffered), and after thus clearing the way and having his audience ask of themselves what then was the trouble with the freeshooter, he gives the real reason, which strikes home and carries so much conviction with it that Agamemnon, in spite of his angry opposition, is compelled to bow, and to acknowledge that it is the finger of god which forces him to yield his prize.</p></span></span>

<p>Agamemnon&#x27;s fury is aroused as he thinks he detects a plot (of which Calchas and Achilles are the ringleaders) to rob him of his prize. Apparently he has slight heed for priests and prophets and holy men. His whole attitude toward the seer is one of burning scorn and bitter sarcasm. Although he does not use the word, he forcibly suggests that Calchas is a liar. &quot;Should thy lies make men hold their peace?&quot; &quot;Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination?&quot; Besides, the gods could be dishonest at times. Thus Zeus sends a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, and Jehovah might send a lying spirit to deceive the prophets. It may be that the poet would represent here a phase of the age-long struggle between rationalism (Agamemnon) and religion (Calchas). 106-108 are merely the ordinary exaggeration common to the heat of passion. Cf. I Kings 22, 19-23; Ezek. 14, 9; II Thess. 2, 11.</p>

  <h3>THE APHRODITE OF MELOS</h3>
  <span>Louvre, Paris</span>
  <p>More commonly known as the &quot;Venus of Milo.&quot; The statue was discovered in 1820 A.D. on the island of Melos. It consists of two principal pieces, joined together across the folds of the drapery. Most art critics date this work about 100 B.C. The strong, serene figure of the goddess sets forth the Greek ideal of female loveliness.</p>

<p><span><span>τι</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#">780-781</a>. After sneering at Calchas, Agamemnon hastens to add his own defense for not accepting the ransoms and releasing the girl. He is careful however not to mention his own brutal speech to the priest. Evidently he is in love with Chryseïs, who is much younger than his own wife whom he had married in the days of his youth (<i>κουριδίης</i>), a situation of the sort which has produced many of the world&#x27;s most interesting</p>
         
<span class="page-break" id="p.86">[pg. 86]</span>


         <p>tragedies. Apparently he would be more than willing to get rid of Clytaem(n)estra and marry the girl. Unfortunately we are left entirely in the dark as to how this was to be done. It would be interesting to know whether Agamemnon has in mind some practical means of disposing of Clytaem(n)estra, as by divorce, or whether this is merely a vision of an unrealizable happiness, and he can only live on in the vague hope that perhaps she may die first. Perhaps it is only another example of &quot;Maggie, my wife at fifty, grey and dour and old, with never another Maggie to be purchased for love or gold.&quot; By a tragic sort of ironical poetic justice, Clytaem(n)estra settled accounts with Agamemnon upon his return home, by murdering him, having proved as unfaithful to him as he had been to her in his absence. This would of course be brought vividly to the minds of Homer&#x27;s hearers when Agamemnon here mentions her name.</p>
         <p>115 ff. Instead of dealing in generalities, Agamemnon specifies the qualities which make Chryseïs seem lovely and desirable in his eyes. By <i>δέμας</i> he refers to her stately build. The old Greeks never seem to have found the petite particularly adorable, and they especially admired women of large and imposing stature. By <i>φυήν</i> he refers to grace of form and feature, and <i>φρένας</i> probably means that she was of an affectionate disposition, implying a marked contrast in this respect with his own Clytaem(n)estra. In other words, &quot;Maggie is pretty to look at, Maggie&#x27;s a loving lass.&quot; And then, to crown all, he refers to <i>ἔργα</i>, her accomplishments. These were not of the highly impractical sort sometimes found in modern times, but the <i>ἔργα</i> of this young lady, which found such a responsive chord in Agamemnon&#x27;s soul, were housewifely accomplishments. She was doubtless a good cook (&quot;For beauty won&#x27;t help if vittles is cold, and Love ain&#x27;t enough for a soldier&quot;), could spin and weave, kept his soldier hut neat and clean, and saw to it that his clothes were kept properly mended.</p>

      <section class="paragraph" id="div-116">
         <p><span><span>καί</span></span>: even.</p>
<p><span><span>εἰ τό γ᾽ ἅμεινόν (ἐστιν)</span></span>: Agamemnon still would intimate that it is not for the best, and takes advantage of this opportunity for another innuendo at the honesty of the seer.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-117">
         <p><span><span>ἤ</span></span>: rather than.</p>
         <p>Seeing that he has to give her up, Agamemnon makes the best of the situation, and by the addition of the last two verses (116-117) effectively wins over the common soldiery to his side, an important consideration in subsequent developments. This is a good speech and well worked out in every way.</p>
         <p>The <i>ἐγώ</i> of vs. 117 echoes the <i>ἐγώ</i> of vs. 111, and effectively refutes the accusation there made.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-119">
         <p>&quot;Even if I should not demand a <i>γέρας</i> as justly due to me in return for my giving back mine, common decency would require that the king should have one, and thus not be lacking in this matter of honor, while all the other chieftains have prizes.&quot; The possession of the <i>γέρας</i> was looked upon as a mark of honor due to royal station;</p>
         
<span class="page-break" id="p.89">[pg. 89]</span>


         <p>to give one was to honor the king and exalt his station; to take it away without due recompense was felt as a keen disgrace. This the army must prevent by giving him an equivalent for the prize he is about to surrender. Thus Agamemnon&#x27;s demand is prompted by his feeling of wounded honor, and by his inherent sense of the prerogatives due to his exalted station, and not by avarice as Achilles thinks (vs. 122).</p>
         <p>The injustice in his claim consists in his demand for immediate (<i>αὐτίχ&#x27;</i>) recompense, which Achilles clearly shows to be impracticable, without committing an injustice to the others. But Achilles unfortunately goes entirely too far in insulting the king and accusing him of avarice beyond all other men.</p>

         <p>Achilles, who has summoned the assembly and who has promised protection to Calchas, is the logical candidate to answer Agamemnon, and doubtless all eyes were turned in his direction as Agamemnon finished his harangue.

The Greeks had already captured and plundered many cities of the Troad, but had not yet been able to take Troy.

<p><span><span>παρελεύσεαι</span></span> is a figure taken from the race course : you shall not pass (me). Agamemnon begins his speech as did Achilles (vs. 122) by addressing his opponent with a highly honorable title, which is immediately followed by an abusive term. The fight is on, and there is no turning back now. — <i>κλέπτε νόῳ</i>, to Agamemnon any one who had the presumption to oppose the will of the mighty king of men must be a scoundrel; and as Calchas was a liar (vs. 108, etc.), so Achilles is a thief at heart. This accusation would be a grave insult to the free and frank Achilles. On another occasion, when referring by innuendo to Agamemnon, he says, &quot;For hateful to me even as the gates of hell is he that hideth one thing in his heart and uttereth another.&quot; Agamemnon feels sure that Achilles is trying to steal his prize from him secretly, by having him give her up without bestowing another upon him. He is not satisfied with a vague promise of future recompense, contingent upon an uncertainty, the sack of Troy. Achilles speaks what is right and true; on the other hand, the claims of Agamemnon are not without justice. Thus the poet with surpassing art attributes to each the words and sentiments from which it was impossible for the quarrel to be avoided.</p>

         <p>Said in scornful and bitter derision. The question is of course &quot;rhetorical,&quot; and is a much stronger presentment of his view than if he had made the positive assertion and accusation that Achilles had such a plan in mind. The answer of Agamemnon to the charge of covetousness by Achilles, is that Achilles is the one who has a selfish end in view, and that he wishes further to disgrace the commander-in-chief in the eyes of the army by taking away his prize of honor, while he keeps his own. <i>· αὐτός</i> : yourself, as contrasted with me and my situation.</p>

         <p>This is perhaps pure subterfuge. Agamemnon may not be considering the possibility he mentions here, but may have caught an evil inspiration to rob Achilles of his prize, and so when he assails him by demanding <i>μὴ κλέπτε νόῳ</i> (vss. 131-132), he may be employing a device known the world around, of accusing his enemy of a crime which he is contemplating himself.

         <p>This is all more subterfuge. Agamemnon has not the slightest intention of disturbing his two good and powerful friends, Ajax and Odysseus, in their vested rights, but the whole passage is aimed at Achilles. Agamemnon here mentions these two mighty chieftains to indicate his own superiority. 139. &quot;I am inclined to think that he (<i>ὁ</i> said with a meaning look at Achilles) may be enraged.&quot; This is a good example of the grimly humoresque in which Homer&#x27;s heroes sometimes indulge.

         <p>To rob Achilles of his prize, and at the same time to compel him to become an active instrument in his own undoing, at the behest of his deadliest and most hated enemy, is the height of ironical tragedy.

         <p><span><span>βοῦς = βόας</span></span>: throughout all history cattle have been an important economic factor. Thus the English words &quot;fee, chattel, pecuniary,&quot; etc., indicate the part they have played in our own and in the Roman monetary systems, as a medium of exchange, before the introduction of coinage. In Homer&#x27;s time maidens were called cattle-bringing, because their suitors regularly gave cattle to their fathers as a wedding present, in return for the girl as a wife. A useful woman in Homeric times might be worth as much as four cows. Their great importance has made them an object of divine worship among many peoples, as among the old Hebrews, who for a long period of their history worshipped a bull-god, of which the horns of the altar were a survival.</p>

         <p>Observe the heaping up of the first personal pronouns in this passage, to indicate that Achilles had no personal interest, as did Agamemnon, in the expedition. Achilles emphasizes his own generous motives and self-sacrificing spirit in joining the undertaking, thereby throwing into high relief the ingratitude of Agamemnon and the deep injustice of his selfishness. &quot;The Trojans have never done me the slightest harm, that</p>

         <p>Such wanton robbery and destruction of property might be either the occasion or the result of war. The origin of the Homeric wars, as most wars before and since, had ultimately an economic basis, and they were waged either to protect their own property or to gain possession of that of their neighbors. &quot;And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.... And so it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the East, even they came up against them; and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou comest to Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.&quot; &quot;And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you...; and I delivered them into your hand. And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive trees which ye planted not do ye eat. Now therefore fear Jehovah and serve him.&quot; &quot;And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. ... And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.&quot;</p>

         <p>A reply to the assertion of Achilles in vs. 159. This is a good example of the subtle irony of the poet; for it is Zeus and no other who dishonors Agamemnon in the sequel. The king&#x27;s proud speech here and his haughty presumption upon the favor of Zeus, the natural protector of kings, thus make his later discomfiture all the more striking and humiliating.</p>

         <p>&quot;Granted that you are brave and mighty (thus acknowledging Achilles&#x27; assertion of the important part he had played in the war, vss. 165-166), you do not deserve any credit for that, as not you but some god is responsible, who gave it all to you without any effort or wit on your part.&quot;</p>

Observe the hissing effect produced by the heaping up of sigmas in this and the preceding verse. <i>Μυρμιδόνεσσιν</i> receives prominence by its position in the verse, since Agamemnon wishes to make clear to Achilles the limits of his authority, and that he has no right to be issuing commands to the Achaeans. Agamemnon will bear no infringement of his own prerogatives.</p>

         <p>In this whole passage Agamemnon assumes a tone of sneering sarcasm and contempt for Achilles, as though he were but a peevish and willful child. Thus he belittles Achilles&#x27; every motive and excellence. His threat to return home is interpreted as due to panicky fear, his bravery in war, his impetuous spirit, and his strength of will, are all qualities which make him a nuisance as a quarrelsome and contentious fellow. &quot;Pray don&#x27;t let me detain you,&quot; he says, &quot; if you are in such a hurry to flee. It will be a blessing to see you gone, since you are so perverse and given to strife. Be sure to take all your bags and baggage along, and don&#x27;t be trying to strut around here with your authority, but run along home to the Myrmidons, where you belong. Pout away all you please. Your anger is the least of my worries. It is all the same to me whether you hold a grudge or not, and just to show you how much I care, I shall threaten you as follows:&quot; This all proves too much for Achilles, who feels now that he cannot return home without provoking the ridicule of</p>

         <p>The situation has now reached the point where Achilles feels constrained to act, as he would rather die than endure such deep insults and humiliation at the hands of his most despised enemy. The imperfects in the first two verses make the description strikingly vivid and picturesque, while the hurried action of the two following aorists are well adapted to introduce Athena suddenly and dramatically. The appearance of Athena is as unexpected, and is introduced with as much dramatic effect as the intervention of the angel when Abraham was getting ready to perform the final act in the sacrifice of Isaac: &quot;And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham : and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him.&quot;</p>

And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.&quot; The Homeric divinity never appears to a group, but only to individuals. Besides it would have spoiled the plot had Athena been seen or heard by the other Greeks, including Agamemnon.</p>

Achilles seems displeased at Athena&#x27;s interference, and is greatly vexed that he should be prevented from killing Agamemnon. <i>αὐτε</i> does not of necessity refer to an earlier appearance of Athena, but may merely denote Achilles&#x27; impatience that one trouble after another seems to have befallen him; and so he says, &quot;And have you come too&quot; (as an addition to all my other vexations) ? - <i>εἰλήλουθας</i>, <a class="reference" href="#n11681168">1168</a>.</p>

         <p>Beginning with vs. 224, Achilles now feels free to answer Agamemnon; and so he pours out his wrath, makes a prophecy of the future, and sits down, while Agamemnon remains silent, possibly because he is speechless from rage. Achilles employs no word of honor in his address this time, but lays to with the most abusive epithets at his command. In his anger, he is guilty of untruthful exaggeration in charging Agamemnon with drunkenness, shamelessness, and cowardice. As a matter of fact, Agamemnon was brave as a lion.</p>

Achilles swears by the sceptre as a symbol of his royal power, with the implication that he hopes to lose it if he swears falsely. Slightly different is the implication when he swears by Apollo (vs. 86). See the note there, <a class="reference" href="#n197197">197</a>. The gods swore by the river Styx.

Observe how in the moment of highest tension Homer goes quietly on, here introducing a description which vivifies the object for his hearers. This sceptre is studded with golden rivets. We need not feel compelled to infer therefrom that every sceptre mentioned by Homer as golden was merely studded with golden rivets, as the poet does not feel obliged to be strongly and carefully consistent, but always feels free to vary according to the necessity of the situation and the effect he wished to produce. Thus the gods are at times strictly anthropomorphic, with very human limitations, at other times they are thought of as</p>

         <p>ethereal, omnipotent, and eternal, corresponding closely to the varied conceptions of Jehovah in the Old Testament. ·<i>χρυσείοις ἥλοισι πεπαρμένον</i> : this addition by way of description in the moment of greatest suspense is characteristic of the objectivity of the poet&#x27;s art. He is so little touched personally by the content of what he relates, that he makes his way undisturbed through the strife of the kings without taking sides, and in the midst of the greatest excitement he still has an eye for details. He sees not only the wrath of the chieftains but also the golden heads of the nails, driven into the sceptre as a crude sort of ornament. It may be too that the poet wished to increase the tension by keeping his audience in suspense a moment longer, before telling them what happened next.</p>

         <p><span><span>τῷ</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#n998998">998</a>. The figure of Nestor has become proverbial for very old age. Reckoning a generation at about a third of a century, as did the ancient Greeks, he would be somewhere between seventy and a hundred years of age. This is an imaginative touch of the poet, to obtain a necessary character for a particular rôle, and does not require a rational explanation. He had lived long and experienced much, and had no aversion to telling long stories of his earlier experiences, and to offering all sorts of good advice, which was rarely acted upon. He is one of the best drawn of Homer&#x27;s characters. Like old Polonius, he was wordy and futile. Since brevity was the soul of wit, he would be brief - with many words, and proffer his advice, in and out of season, usually to the irritation of all concerned.</p>

Here it is the dative of accompaniment with <i>ἅμα</i>. - <i>τράφεν (= ἐτράφησαν) ἠδὲ γένοντο</i>, hysteron proteron, i.e. the time represented by <i>ἐγένοντο</i> comes before that of <i>τράφεν</i>, although <i>τράφεν</i> here precedes <i>ἐγένοντο</i>. This is a permissible device, as it indicates priority of interest, instead of the usual one of time. Compare Shakespere&#x27;s &quot;I was bred and born.&quot; The main idea is contained in the first expression, while the second is added as an after-thought, for the sake of greater fullness and accuracy.</p>

<p><span><span>οἱ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν</span></span>: it is characteristic of tradition in less advanced stages of civilization to feel sure that the world is growing worse, that men have degenerated from a garden-of-Eden stage, when all the world was bright and happy, when no man did wrong, sickness and sin and sorrows were not, and the race of men was much better physically as well as morally than succeeding generations. Since that time the world has continued to decline till it has reached its present deplorable state. Such ideas flourish actively in an uncritical and credulous age, when men are perfectly willing to believe of a former period that &quot;there were giants in the earth in those days; the same became mighty men, which were of old men of renown.&quot; Thus Homer feels convinced that the warriors whose doughty deeds he sings were far superior to the race of mortals of his own time. For example, he says &quot;with his hand the son of Tydeus seized a stone, a mighty weight, which not even two men could carry, such as mortals now are, but even alone he waved it easily.&quot; And again of Nestor&#x27;s cup he says &quot;another man with great effort could have moved it from the table when it was full, but Nestor, though an old man, raised</p>

         <p>it with ease.&quot; And again: &quot;Hector snatched up a stone and lifted it, which not even two of the best men of the people, such as men now are, could pry from the ground upon a wagon with crowbars, but he easily brandished it alone.&quot; Furthermore, Homer&#x27;s characters, and those of epic in general, are divine, or greater than ordinary mortals.</p>

         <p>Never has (any other) sceptre-bearing king obtained honor equal (to that of Agamemnon). That is, according to the Homeric tradition, as placed in the mouth of Nestor, Agamemnon was the mightiest ruler of his time; therefore Achilles should yield precedence to him. Nestor emphasizes the divine right of kings, who have obtained their authority by grace of god, and as such are his representatives on earth. To oppose one would be blasphemous; for they are the Lord&#x27;s own ancinted. &quot;And it came to pass afterward that David&#x27;s heart smote him because he had cut off Saul&#x27;s skirt. And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord&#x27;s anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing that he is the anointed of the Lord.&quot; &quot;David and Abishai came to the people by night; and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster. Then said Abishai unto David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him a second time. And David said unto Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord&#x27;s anointed, and be guiltless?&quot;</p>

         <p><span><span>ὅδ᾽ ἀνήρ</span></span> is said by Agamemnon with supreme contempt, as he does not even deign to mention the hated name of his opponent: &quot;this fellow.&quot;</p>
         <p>Agamemnon apparently agrees with Nestor&#x27;s contention, but will admit no fault of his own, throwing all the blame on Achilles. He insists further that his overlordship be formally recognized by the rebellious spirit of Achilles (see vss. 54, 59 ff., etc.), but Achilles refuses. Agamemnon is not altogether without justice on his side, as Achilles has done much to call his authority in question and has set a bad precedent in case there should be difficulty in the future.</p>

He is afraid that some one will call him a coward if he yields to Agamemnon&#x27;s demand that he recognize his authority, and so he finally decides that he would rather give up the girl, even though he does love her (see note to vs. 348) than yield to Agamemnon&#x27;s wishes. He has now come to the point of open rebellion against the king, and flatly refuses to take any further orders from him or to recognize his authority, as Agamemnon had insisted.</p>
         <p><span><span>εἵνεκα κούρης</span></span> is said with supreme contempt. &quot;I would not fight with my hands on account of a girl.&quot; Achilles attempts to conceal his real feelings, as he sees that he has no way of successfully opposing the king and his forces. Before closing, however, he makes it quite plain that he holds all the Greeks responsible for the wrong done him, because they have not the courage to oppose Agamemnon&#x27;s arrogance, and thus through. him they are taking back the prize they once gave.</p>

         <p>297-303. These words of Achilles come pretty close to the ridiculous, and doubtless provoked loud hoots and jeers from Agamemnon&#x27;s partisans. The whole quarrel had been about the girl; and Achilles by this statement throws his cause completely overboard and brings up another subject having nothing to do with the question. Agamemnon had never remotely intimated that he was considering anything of this kind.</p>

Like Agamemnon (vs. 7) Patroclus is first introduced by his patronymic, because he was such a well-known figure of the legend that it was not necessary to be more specific. He and Achilles were fast friends, and he stood by Achilles through all this period of trial. It is only his death in battle which furnishes a motive sufficiently powerful to induce Achilles to take a further part in the fighting. His introduction at this point is very skillfully done, as it is clearly indicated where he stands in relation to the hero.</p>

         <p>The whole army had been made unclean by Agamemnon&#x27;s guilt, as had happened to the army of Joshua because of Achan: so they must be purified. Physical cleanness, acquired by washing, symbolized ritualistic purity, just as the rite of baptism typifies the washing away of the sinner&#x27;s guilt. To a mind lacking in poetic and creative imagination, it might occur that we have here a real hint as to the cause of such a plague, in a lack of proper sanitary measures and of bodily cleanliness on the part of the Greeks. After they had given themselves a good scouring, the plague ceased. In the same way, many of the &quot;laws of Moses,&quot; with their ritual of purification, rested ultimately upon a dimly discerned sanitary basis. &quot;He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days; the same shall purify himself&quot; (with water and ashes).</p>

         <p>Observe how closely these two verses echo and recall verses 25 ff., especially vs. 34, where Agamemnon dismisses the old priest so harshly, to the woe of the Greeks. So here the hot temper of the king is preparing further trouble for his followers. The ships of the Greeks were drawn up in lines along the shore. Those of Odysseus were in the centre, while the two ends, the most dangerous positions, were held by Achilles and Ajax, as the most redoubtable warriors of the whole army, for they trusted in their manhood and the strength of their arms. The assembly would be near the centre of the line by the ships of Odysseus.</p>

         <p><span><span>ἀέκουσ&#x27;(α)</span></span> is a delicate touch of the poet, showing that Briseïs returned Achilles&#x27; affection, and that Achilles is angry not merely because of wounded honor. This adds to the pathos of the situation. Later Achilles himself says, &quot;But why must the Argives make war on the Trojans? Why hath the son of Atreus gathered his host and led them thither? Is it not for lovely-haired Helen&#x27;s sake? Do then the sons of Atreus alone of mortal men love their wives? Surely whatsoever man is good and sound of mind loveth his own and cherisheth her, even as I too loved mine with all my heart, though but the captive of my spear. But now that he hath taken my prize of honor from my arms and hath deceived me, let him not tempt me that know him full well; he shall not prevail.&quot; It is this true affection between Achilles and Briseïs which makes the present situation so inexpressibly bitter for him. Homer does not waste words in farewell scenes, and here he sums up the feelings of Briseïs in a single adjective.</p>

      <section class="paragraph" id="div-349">
         <p><i>δακρύσας</i>, <a class="reference" href="#n10811081">1081</a>: by this simple description the hearer was made to see the effect of the situation on Achilles, and to infer the depth of</p>

         <p>his feelings. He &quot;burst into tears,&quot; partly perhaps from grief, but even more in hot and helpless anger at the insults that had been heaped upon him. Homer&#x27;s heroes are highly emotional, and are not ashamed to give full expression to their feelings. They are no more dainty about the shedding of tears than they are over the shedding of blood. Later, when the battle has been going against the Greeks, Homer says of Agamemnon, &quot;The son of Atreus was stricken to the heart with sore grief, and went about bidding the clear-voiced heralds summon every man by name to the assembly. ... So they sat sorrowful in assembly, and Agamemnon stood up weeping like unto a fountain of dark water that from a beetling cliff poureth down its black stream; even so with ... deep groaning he spake among the Argives.&quot;</p>

It is eminently proper that Achilles should be represented as looking out upon the deep; since the boundless sea with its countless, never-resting waves, corresponds to the endless tumult of his troubled soul.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-351">
         <p><span><span>μητρί</span></span>: her name is Thetis, but is not yet mentioned, as it was well known to the hearers of the bard. She had been wooed by Zeus and Poseidon, but when Zeus learned that she was fated to bear a son mightier than his father, he forced her against her will, goddess though she was, to marry Peleus, by whom she bore Achilles. When Achilles set out for the Trojan war, she packed his trunk with plenty of warm woolen articles of wear, deserted her husband, and returned to her old home in the sea, that she might be near her beloved son in whose fortunes she took a passionate interest.</p>
         <p><span><span>χεῖρας ὀρεγνύς</span></span>: when the ancients prayed they regularly stretched out their hands in the direction of the divinity whom they entreated. If this were a god of heaven, they lifted up their hands toward the sky; if a god of the sea, they stretched out their hands as Achilles does here; if a god of the lower world, they might even sit down and beat upon the ground to attract his attention.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-352">
         <p>It is a distinctly human touch that Achilles should turn to his mother for consolation; for women are often inclined to be sympathetic and to take the side of their children. Thus when Aphrodite gets her hand scratched in battle by the spear of Diomedes, she shrieks aloud, and hurries back to heaven, where she falls into her mother&#x27;s lap and sobs out her grief. Her mother of course consoles her, and strokes the hand which has been hurt, and it is all cured once more. In the same way a modern mother might kiss her little child&#x27;s head which he bumped when he fell down. On the other hand, Ares, the god of war,</p>

         <p>who has been severely wounded in battle, but who is out of favor with his mother, is stupid enough to carry his tale of woe to his father. Homer says, &quot;swiftly he came to the gods&#x27; dwelling, steep Olympus, and sat beside Zeus, son of Cronus, with grief in his heart, and showed the immortal blood flowing from the wound, and piteously spake to him winged words. ... Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at him and said: &#x27;Nay, thou renegade, sit not beside me and whine.&#x27;&quot;</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-352">
         <p><span><span>μινυνθάδιον</span></span>: Achilles had the choice of a long and inglorious life, or one short and full of renown. He had chosen the latter, and now that he has made this choice, his situation is one of deep pathos. It is this certainty of an early death which casts its gloom over all the rest of his days. He seems later to have become somewhat more reconciled to this, and when he is entreated with piteous words by one of the Trojans to spare his life, he says, &quot;Aye, friend, thou too must die: why lamentest thou? Patroclus too is dead, who was better far than thou. Seest thou not also what manner of man am I for might and goodliness? Yet over me too hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or some noonday when my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear he smite or arrow from the string.&quot; The old Greeks were so in love with life that death seemed clothed with more than ordinary gloom. When Odysseus meets the soul of Achilles in Hades he tries to console him by saying &quot;As for thee, Achilles, none other than thou wast heretofore the most blessed of men, nor shall any be hereafter. For of old, in the days of thy life, we Argives gave thee one honor with the gods, and now thou art a great prince here among the dead. Wherefore let not thy death be any grief to thee, Achilles.&quot; But Achilles replies, &quot;Nay, speak not to me comfortably of death, O great Odysseus. Rather would I live on ground as the hireling of another, with a landless man who had no great livelihood, than to rule over all that have gone down to death.&quot;</p>

         <p><span><span>ὑψιβρεμέτης</span></span>: thunder and lightning were ordinary accompaniments of the gods of old. In fact, primitive man often thought that thunder was the actual voice of his god, who thus roared, growled, and muttered on high. In Hebrew, for example, the ordinary expression for thunder is qol Jahweh, &quot;the voice of Jehovah.&quot; &quot;Jehovah shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shali mightily roar against his fold.&quot; &quot;And Jehovah shall roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth</p>

         <p>shall shake.&quot; &quot;Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the muttering that goeth out of his mouth. He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: God thundereth marvelously with his voice.&quot; &quot;And Jehovah thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice. And he sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning and discomfited them.&quot; &quot;And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. ... And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mount.&quot; Even in a later age the voice of a divinity might in some cases be mistaken for thunder by the uninitiated: &quot;Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.&quot;</p>

         <p>The two spondees at the beginning of this verse give it an especially heavy, halting effect. Some would see in this an attempt of the poet in his verse to paint the feelings of Achilles in his choking anger when he recalls this part of the situation. Achilles does not give an absolutely truthful account of matters. Naturally he does not emphasize his own part wherein he might be blamed, in calling the assembly without the sanction of the king, or even without consulting him, and then bluntly coming forward with a public proposal that the expedition be given up, and later instigating the seer to make his declaration, which was the immediate cause of Agamemnon&#x27;s violent outburst.</p>

            <h3>&quot;TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE (POSEIDON),&quot; PÆSTUM</h3>
            <p>Pæstum, the Greek Poseidonia, was a colony of Sybaris. The malarial atmosphere of the place led to its desertion in the ninth century of our era. Hence the buildings there were not used as quarries for later structures. The so-called &quot;Temple of Neptune (Poseidon)&quot; at Pæstum is one of the best preserved monuments of antiquity.</p></span>

Divinities of heaven commonly have clouds at their command, either to bring rain, or often in which to wrap themselves. &quot;Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp to our God: who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth.&quot; &quot;And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light.&quot; &quot;And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.&quot;</p>

         <p>This is to explain why his request cannot be granted immediately. It also motivates the inactivity of Achilles for this period, thus throwing into strong relief his abiding anger. The gods were always ready to enjoy a good dinner. Here there is a more or less conscious contrast between their happy, care-free existence and that of the heroes of the Iliad, which was so full of bitter sorrow. This verse seems to be in contradiction with the preceding account, according to which Apollo is at hand, shooting his arrows; Hera is in heaven, from which she sends Athena, who returns thither to the other divinities. But the poet could count on the indulgence of his hearers not to be hypercritical in such matters. His desire to produce striking dramatic effects, and to motivate various actions, sometimes leads him into such slight inconsistencies, and the same can be said of many another great author.</p>

         </span>
         <p>a purer and more moral form than their later and more degenerate descendants, who have been corrupted by their culture and lost their original simplicity. Thus Rousseau (The Inequality of Man): &quot;Men are bad; my own sad experience furnishes the proof; yet man is naturally good, as I think I have shown. What then can so have degraded him except the changes in his condition, the progress he has made, and the knowledge he has acquired?&quot; In another place (Emile) he says: &quot;Coming from the hand of the Author of all things, everything is good; in the hands of man everything degenerates. Man obliges one soil to nourish the productions of another, one tree to bear the fruits of another; he mingles and confounds climates, elements, seasons; he mutilates his dog, his horse, his slave. He overturns everything, disfigures everything; he loves deformity, monsters; he desires that nothing should be as nature made it, not even man himself. To please him, man must be broken in like a horse; man must be adapted to Man&#x27;s own fashion, like a tree in his garden.&quot; Cf. the note on vs. 272, § 355.</p>
         <p>These verses give the final touches to the structure which furnishes a reasonable motive for Achilles to remain inactive instead of returning home as he had threatened (vs. 169), § 270.</p>

         <p>mony, as the modern Roman Catholics use holy water. &quot;And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put water therein. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto Jehovah: so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not.&quot;</p>
         <p><span><span>οὐλοχύτᾶς</span></span>: the use of whole barleycorns is a survival, due to religious conservatism, of a distinctly primitive practice. At an early day, before men knew how to grind their grain, they offered it whole to their gods. As civilization advanced, religious ceremonies, with their static tendency, remained practically unchanged, and whole barleycorns were still offered to their gods. In the same way the feast of unleavened bread among the old Hebrews was probably a survival of a primitive practice, inherited from a stage when they had not yet learned the use of leaven.</p>

Observe that the old priest uses exactly the same words in opening this prayer as he did in the one in which he prayed for vengeance upon the Greeks (vs. 37 ff.), and furthermore we are told in identically the same words at the end: <i>τοῦ δ᾽ ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων.</i> Thus the second prayer is intended by the poet to echo the first, and to bring this situation more vividly before the minds of his hearers. This furnishes a good example, and the first in European literature, of what is known as a palinode.</p>

The wine was mixed with water, just as is the custom among the peasants of modern Greece. &quot;For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant and delighteth the taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story.&quot; The Greeks usually mixed them in the proportion of three parts of wine to two of water; but the poet Hesiod recommends one part of wine to three of water. The later Greeks, who lacked the stern simplicity of the rustic poet, claimed that this would be more suitable as a drink for fishes than for men.</p>

<p><span><span>ἐπαρξάμενοι</span></span> refers to the beginning of their religious ceremony, which was performed in this case by each of those present pouring a few drops of wine from his cup as a libation before the drinking began. The libation corresponded to the &quot;drink offerings&quot; of the Old Testament. &quot;In the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto Jehovah for a drink offering.&quot; The worshippers thus shared their food and drink (communion) with their god. According to primitive ideas, those who eat of the same loaf and drink of the same cup become of the same flesh and blood when the

  food is assimilated into their bodies. This would thus establish and maintain the strongest possible bond between the divinity and his worshippers. &quot;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body; for we all partake of the one bread.&quot; &quot;But I say that the things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with devils.&quot;</p></span></span>

Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp.&quot; &quot;And David danced before Jehovah with all his might.&quot;</p>

Heaven and Olympus seem to be used here, as elsewhere in Homer, synonymously, without any very consistent picture in the mind of the poet. Apparently the earlier belief in a physical Mount Olympus as the abode of the gods was passing through a stage in which it was rapidly becoming idealized, following pretty much the same course as the Christian belief in a heaven and a hell, which were once thought of as very real places.</p>

<p><span><span>ἔπι δεέος</span></span>: some more subtle flattery on the part of Thetis, &quot;you are so brave,&quot; but delicious humor on the part of the poet, who knows that Zeus is afraid, and that nothing else is holding him back.</p><p>To get the full benefit of this scene, it must be understood that although Thetis addresses Zeus as <i>πάτερ</i> (vs. 503), this is merely an honorary title, to indicate his majesty and superior power among all the gods and men. As a matter of fact, Thetis was an old flame of Zeus. She must be thought of as eternally young and surpassingly beautiful.
     <span class="page-break" id="p.182">[pg. 182]</span>
    </p><p>She sets about her task with consummate skill and tact. She does not dwell on the fact that Zeus was deeply indebted to her (vs. 394 ff.), but passes this over lightly with an <i>εἴ ποτε</i> (vs. 503). Her realization of the masculine weaknesses, and her ability to turn them to her own account, are good, as is best seen by her choice of epithets in addressing Zeus. First of all, as we have seen, he is <i>πάτερ</i>, as supreme ruler and arbiter of the fates of all. In 508 she addresses him as μητίετα, and later she says <i>οὗ τοι ἔπι δέος</i>. The modern equivalents would be &quot;you are so wise ... you are so brave.&quot; And since he is so wise and so brave, he would do anything for her if he loved her. <a class="reference" href="#">515-516</a> is practically a challenge: &quot;Don&#x27;t do it if you don&#x27;t want to, and then I shall know that you don&#x27;t care for me.&quot; She probably used a piteously tearful voice for this last plea, and of course there is nothing left for Zeus but unconditional surrender.</p><p>It is a particularly fine touch of the poet where he represents Zeus as sitting for a long time in contemplative silence (vs. 512), while Thetis prattles on, and in vs. 515 where she says, &quot;You are not afraid of any thing.&quot; As a matter of fact, it is fear and nothing else which is troubling the father of gods and men. He is afraid of his own wife, and what she will say when she finds out. It would be beside the question to ask whether Thetis knew this in vs. 515, since she is consciously flattering Zeus, and need not be held to a strict accountability for absolute truthfulness.</p></span></span>

Aphrodite, to  <span class="page-break" id="p.184">[pg. 184]</span>
      
      reward Paris for showing such good judgment, gave him Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, to be his wife. But as Helen was already married to Menelaus, her elopement with Paris to Troy brought on the Trojan War, undertaken by the Greeks for the purpose of bringing her home.</p><p>The abject terror of the father of gods and men, who raises his voice almost to a whimper, as he tells how he is imposed upon at home, is intended by the poet to produce a comic effect, and the remainder of the first book of the Iliad is not merely comical but ludicrous at times. This is carefully worked out by the poet, not merely as furnishing a foil to his heroes, but for the purpose of providing a rest for his hearers and a highly acceptable variety after the tensely tragical scenes of the preceding. This whole passage, with the differences in tone of voice, gesture, and manner, would offer especial opportunities to the bard in reciting his verses.</p><p>It seems hardly chivalrous of Zeus to drag out the skeleton from the family closet for the inspection of Thetis, but he must remove the suspicion, half expressed by her in vs. 516, that he does not care for her. Throughout this whole scene he treats Thetis as though she were an innocent little girl, whom he is anxious to please, even at the expense of his own discomfort. So he says in his kindest tones: &quot;You hurry along back home, and I will attend to all this.

It is interesting to observe that the nod of Zeus establishes his word as truthful and irrevocable, whereas he plainly intimates that any mere promise on his part might be deceitful and might be broken at any time, if it so pleased him. This idea may go back to the practice which the images of the gods sometimes had of nodding a confirmation to some of the prayers offered in the temples.</p>

The calm majesty of these verses is in marked contrast to the preceding anxious fear of Hera, just displayed by the father of gods and men, which gives almost a grotesque effect.</p><p>It may be that the poet intended something of the kind in making Olympus tremble at his nod, as on another occasion Hera makes Olympus tremble by bouncing angrily about on her throne. The presence or movements of divinities commonly made the earth and mountains trem-</p><span><h3>THE OLYMPIEUM AT ATHENS</h3></span><p>ble, as when Poseidon, the god of the sea, is passing along with swift footsteps, the mountains trembled, and the forests, beneath the immortal footsteps of the god as he moved. &quot;And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.&quot; &quot;Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah.&quot; &quot;Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of heaven moved, and were shaken, because he was wroth.&quot;</p>

<p><span><span>οἱ</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#n10041004">1004</a>. Hera shows a keenly feminine instinct. Without having to be told, she recognizes the situation. Perhaps Zeus showed his guilt in his countenance, or else he may have looked more fearful than usual. Of course she loses no time in giving him a &quot;piece of her mind,&quot; and turns loose all her pent-up fury. In addition to forming a pleasing variety, this scene is employed by the poet to make his hearers more familiar with the attitude of the other divinities toward the <i>βουλή</i> of Zeus (vs. 5), upon which the action of the whole poem turns.</p>

Zeus was preeminently the Don Juan of the gods. Hera naturally resents his policy of secrecy in keeping everything hid from her. The soul of Agamemnon in Hades, who had a particularly hard time of it with his own wife, and was finally killed by her with an ax, thus advises Odysseus: &quot;Wherefore, do thou too never be soft even to thy wife, neither show her all the counsel that thou knowest, but a part declare and let a part be hid. ... And yet another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart. Put thy ship to land in secret, and not openly, on the shore of thy dear country; for there is no more faith in woman.&quot;</p>

<p>Zeus begins in a grandiose style, and tells Hera pompously (the spondaic ending of vs. 548 helps to give this effect) that his plans are too deep for her understanding, seeing that she is only a woman. Whenever he wants her to know anything he will tell her, so far as it may be proper for her to hear. And further, just think! he will tell her the very first, before anybody else. She must keep quiet now, and stop prying into his private affairs. All this serves merely to confirm her suspicions and opens the way for a more direct attack. The whole attitude of Zeus toward Hera is pretty much the same as that which furnishes the theme of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House.&quot;</p>

<p>Not a question, but an indignant exclamation. Hera now plays one trump after another. She shows a complete knowledge of the situation, even in its details. It adds to the comedy that she is much brighter than Zeus, whose pompous loftiness takes on a touch of the absurd.</p>

<p>She throws back at Zeus his own words (<i>εἴρομαι, μεταλλάω</i>) in an indignant denial of having been too inquisitive heretofore. On the other hand, she has never before this (<i>πάρος</i>) inquired into his private affairs, &quot;but now (<i>viv</i>) this is too much for a loving and faithful wife like me to endure.&quot;</p>

<p><span><span>δαιμονίη</span></span>: “thou fool.&quot;</p>
<p><span><span>όtea</span></span> echoes the <i>ow</i> of vs. 558. Hera there says, &quot;I imagine,&quot; to which Zeus replies, &quot;Yes, you are always imagining.&quot; If Hera has only made a shrewd guess, the towering rage into which Zeus falls at being so neatly caught would be the best possible confirmation of her suspicions.</p>

<p><span><span>πρῆξαι</span></span>: in this connection it is interesting to observe how well the poet knew human life; for later Hera does succeed in outwitting Zeus and does accomplish (<i>πρήξαι</i>) just what she had in mind here, which Zeus is compelled in his discomfiture to acknowledge: &quot;Thou hast accomplished it at last, O Hera, ox-eyed queen, thou hast aroused Achilles fleet of foot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Granted that this is true&quot; (which I do not). Zeus cannot bring himself to make a clean breast of it.</p>
<p><span><span>ἐμοὶ φίλον</span></span>: autocratic and arbitrary: car tel est notre bon plaisir. Such is my good pleasure, reason enough for the likes of you; cf. Shakespeare, Jul. Caes., “Decius, go tell them (the senators) Caesar will not come.&quot; &quot;Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.&quot; &quot;The cause is in my will, I will not come, that is enough to satisfy the senate.&quot;</p>

Zeus has lost completely in the argument, which makes him very angry, so he now turns to threats of the direst violence. These are not merely empty words either, as we know from another occasion, when he tauntingly reminds Hera that he had once hung her up with her hands tied together and an anvil bound to either foot. On that occasion he threatened to horsewhip her severely. Like patient Job, he finds his own wife too much to endure.</p>

<p><span><span>ἐφείω</span></span> must be understood of blows as violent as Zeus had the power to deliver them. – <i>ἰόνθ᾽ (ἰόντα) (με)</i>.</p><p>This method of silencing Hera, contrary to ordinary human experience in such matters, proves effective. It is necessary for the poetic economy that she be stopped, so that there may be further development in the action of the poem. Besides she is bright enough to see that the best method of having her way is by apparent submission.</p>

<p><i>ἕνεκα θνητών</i>, contemptuously, contrasted with <i>ἐν θεοῖσι</i>. Hephaestus essays the role of mediator, as Nestor did between Agamemnon and Achilles, but with infinitely better success. He is evidently much worried that they two should create such a disturbance over such insignificant creatures as mortals. <i>ἕνεκα θνητῶν</i> is said with the utmost contempt, as being an unworthy cause for such wrangling. Thus, on another occasion, when Poseidon challenges Apollo to a combat, because of their having taken different sides in the Trojan war, Apollo loftily replies, &quot;Shaker of the earth, thou wouldst consider me of unsound mind if I should fight against thee for the sake of pitiful mortals, who like unto leaves now live a glowing life, consuming the fruit of the earth, and now again waste away in death.&quot; On another occasion the poet says: &quot;This is the lot the gods have spun for miserable men, that they should live in pain: yet themselves are sorrowless.&quot;</p>

<p><span><span>ποδός</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#n983983">983</a>. Apparently Zeus seized Hephaestus by one foot, twirled him a time or so around his head, as he would a rabbit, and then let go.</p>
<p><span><span>ἀπὸ βηλοῦ</span></span>: from the threshold (of the palace in heaven). Evidently Zeus enjoyed throwing the gods out of heaven, to vent his rage when angry, as he boasts of this on another occasion: “O Hera, hard to deal with. Nay but yet I know not whether thou mayest not be the first to reap the fruits of thy cruel treason, and I beat thee with stripes. Dost thou not remember, when thou wert hung from on high, and from thy feet I suspended two anvils, and round thy hands I fastened a golden bond that might not be broken? And thou didst hang in the clear air and in the clouds, and the gods were wroth in high Olympus, but they could not come round and loose thee. Nay, whomsoever I might catch, I would clutch, and hurl from the threshold, to come fainting to the earth.&quot; The poet tells us that on another occasion, &quot;But Zeus, when he awakened, was wrathful, and dashed the gods about his mansion.&quot; He was once deceived by the goddess of folly, <span class="page-break" id="p.196">[pg. 196]</span> Até. Thereupon &quot;he seized Até by her bright-haired head in the anger of his soul, and sware a mighty oath that never again to Olympus and the starry heaven should Até come, who blindeth all alike. He said, and whirling her in his hand flung her from the starry heaven, and quickly she arrived among the works of men.&quot;</p><p>We need not demand of our poet absolute consistency in the treatment of various features of his theme; and it would be idle to ask how a god could fall to earth, if thrown out of heaven, when we see them making daily trips from heaven to earth and return, through the air, passing from one to the other in a moment, or very quickly, and without any external assistance. This conception of the fall of Hephaestus, so crudely anthropomorphic, is matched by the Christian legend of Satan having been thrown out of heaven, as developed in Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost. The poet is a little confused also in his topography here, for if the seat of the gods is on the top of Mount Olympus, it would not be possible for Hephaestus to occupy much time in falling to the earth.</p>

<p>The drinks were usually served in Olympus by the goddess Hebé, whose name has become a synonymn for feminine grace and maidenly beauty. In marked contrast to her is Hephaestus, rough, ungainly, and distressingly homely, who here makes his début as cupbearer to the gods, and goes through so many funny motions, like some primitive Charlie Chaplin, that all of them laugh most uproariously.</p><p><span><span>θεοῖσιν</span></span>: <a class="reference" href="#">1004, 1009</a>. This inextinguishable laughter is well motivated psychologically; as the situation has been so exceptionally tense that when there is a change brought about by the comic figure of Hephaestus and his recital of his discomfiture at the hands of Zeus, all are ready to give vent to their pent-up feelings in this undignified fashion.</p>

    <h3>VICTORY OF SAMOTHRACE</h3>
    <span>Louvre, Paris</span>
    <p>Commemorates a naval battle fought in 306 в.с. The statue, which is considerably above life-size, stood on a pedestal having the form of a ship&#x27;s prow. The goddess of Victory was probably represented holding a trumpet to her lips with her right hand. The fresh ocean breeze has blown her garments back into tumultuous folds.</p>

    <p>The first book of the Iliad, after its grim and gloomy beginning amidst the tragedy of earthly life and its unending sorrows, closes amid the laughter of the care-free blessed gods, feasting happily on Olympus, <span>&quot;where, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth fast forever. Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all their days.&quot;</span> This alternate play of light and shade, of laughter and of tears, of stern, dignified men, and frivolous, light-hearted gods, who serve as their foil, is worked out by the poet with remarkable artistic feeling and delicacy of touch. The scene on Olympus as contrasted with the earlier action may best be compared to a satyr play, a kind of burlesque show, which was regularly performed in ancient Athens at the close of a series of tragedies, and for the same purpose, to relieve the minds of the audience.</p>
    <p>With surpassing art the poet has woven into the action and the narrative of this book the most important characters, both human and divine, of the entire poem.</p>
    <p><span>&quot;No book of Homer is so full of dramatic groups and situations as this: Apollo striding with his bow and ringing quiver; Thetis caressing the grieving and angry Achilles; Thetis before Zeus, clasping his knees and extending her right hand toward his chin; Zeus with his dark brows and ambrosial locks nodding a confirmation to his promise; Chryses with his filleted scepter and his gifts, before the two sons of Atreus; Odysseus at the altar of Apollo with the maiden whom he is restoring to her aged father, — with his companions and the hecatomb; Achilles in his rage drawing his sword from its sheath, calmed by Athena, who takes him by his long locks, - with Agamemnon before him and the other chiefs around him; the heralds of Agamemnon at the tent of Achilles, as Patroclus leads forth the fair Briseïs; Zeus and Hera on Olympus, with Hephaestus playing the part of Hebé; the assembly of the gods, Apollo playing the lyre, and the singing muses.&quot;</span></p>

  <h3>INTRODUCTION TO ATTIC GREEK</h3>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-456">
    <p><span>Dialects.</span> - The Greek language was divided into a number of dialects, the most important groups of which were the Aeolic, Ionic (Ionic-Attic), and Doric.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-457">
    <p>Very closely related to Ionic is Attic, and both are usually grouped together as Ionic-Attic. In the great mass of their forms they are fundamentally alike, and differ only in minor details.</p>

  </span>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-458">
    <p>The Homeric poems are composed in what is known as the Homeric dialect, a mixture of Aeolic and Ionic, the bulk of the forms being Ionic (<a class="reference" href="#n620620">620</a>).</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-459">
    <p><span>Contraction.</span> Attic carries the contraction of vowels to a further extent than does any other of the Greek dialects, two or more vowels coming together and admitting of contraction practically never remaining uncontracted.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-460">
    <p>Hence one of the most important things for the student to do in passing from Homeric to Attic Greek is to memorize thoroughly the table of contractions (<a class="reference" href="#">584-585</a>).</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-461">
    <p>In general vowels are contracted in Attic as in Homer (<a class="reference" href="#">584-585</a>), the only exceptions being that <i>ε + ο</i> and <i>ε + ου = ου</i> in Attic instead of <i>ευ</i> in Homer.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-462">
    <p><span>Treatment of <i>α</i> in Attic.</span> After <i>ε, ι, ρ</i>, the <i>η</i> of Homer, when representing an earlier <i>ᾱ</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n621621">621</a>), becomes <i>α</i> in Attic, except that <i>ρρη = ρῃ</i>, as <i>κόρη</i> for <i>κόρρη</i> = Homeric <i>κούρη</i> maiden and <i>ρση = ρρη</i>, as <i>κόρρη</i> for <i>κόρση</i> one of the temples.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-463">
    <p>If <i>ρη</i> is the product of the contraction of <i>ρεα</i> (<a class="reference" href="#">584-585</a>) it remained unchanged, as <i>ὄρη = ὄρεα</i> mountains.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-465">
    <p><span>Consonantal change.</span> - 1) <i>σσ</i> of Homer becomes <i>ττ</i> in Attic, as <i>θάλασσα</i>, <i>πρήσσω</i> of Homer become <i>θάλαττα</i>, <i>πράττω</i> in Attic; except that two sigmas brought together by inflection become <i>σ</i>, as <i>ποσί</i> for <i>ποσσί</i> (<i>ποδσι</i>), <i>ἔπεσι</i> for <i>ἔπεσ-σι</i>, <i>τελέσαι</i> for <i>τελέσ-σαι</i>. 2) <i>ρσ</i> of Homer becomes <i>ρρ</i> in Attic.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-466">
    <p><span>Inflection.</span> In the inflection of words, the chief differences between the Homeric and Attic forms are due to the greater extent to which the Attic dialect carries either contraction (<a class="reference" href="#">584-585</a>), or to which it carries metathesis of quantity (<a class="reference" href="#n573573">573</a>).</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-467">
    <p>Thus Homeric <i>θαλασσάων, ἥρωι,  ἥρωα, ἔπεος, ἔπεα, γέραος, γέραα, πόληος, βασιλῆος, βασιλῆα, βασιλήων, βασιλῆας, νηός, νηῶν</i> regularly become in Attic <i>θαλαττῶν, ἥρῳ, ἥρω, ἔπους, ἔπη, γέρως, γέρα, πόλεως, βασιλέως, βασιλέα, βασιλέων, βασιλέᾶς, νεώς, νεῶν</i>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-468">
    <p><span>Nouns and adjectives.</span> - Attic had the following case endings, either not found or else very uncommon in Homer:</p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li id="item-1"><p>Dual, gen. and dat. end in <i>-οιν</i> instead of <i>-οιιν</i>.</p></li>

  <h3>SYNTAX</h3>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-480">
    <p>The differences in Homeric and Attic syntax can best be learned by the careful study of some good work on Attic prose composition.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-481">
    <p><span>The article.</span> In Attic Greek <i>ὁ, ἡ, τό</i> is regularly employed as the definite article (the), its absence ordinarily marking a noun as indefinite, as <i>ὁ πόλεμος</i> the war, <i>πόλεμος</i> war.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-482">
    <p>At times the article may be omitted, especially in poetry without marking the noun as indefinite.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-483">
    <p>At times it may represent the unemphatic possessive pronoun, as <i>Κύρος καταπεδήσᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος τὸν θώρηκα ἐνέδῦ καὶ ἀναβὰς ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον τὰ πάλτα εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ἔλαβε</i> Cyrus, having leaped down from his chariot, put on his breastplate, and having mounted his horse took his javelins in his hands.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-484">
    <p>It may be employed, especially with adjectives and participles, in a generic sense, denoting a class, as <i>ὁ ἄνθρωπος</i> man(kind), <i>οἱ ἀγαθοί</i> the good, <i>ὁ βουλόμενος</i> anyone who wishes, <i>οἱ γέροντες</i> the aged.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-485">
    <p>It may be used with proper names in familiar style, as <i>ὁ Σωκράτης</i> Socrates.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-486">
    <p>It is used in a variety of ways to form substantives :</p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li id="item-1"><p>With adjectives and participles, as <i>οἱ πλούσιοι</i> the rich, <i>οἱ παρόντες</i> those present.</p></li>
      <li id="item-2"><p>With possessive pronouns, as <i>οἱ σοί</i> your people, <i>τὰ ἡμέτερα</i> our possessions, our affairs.</p></li>
      <li id="item-3"><p>With genitives, as <i>Θουκυδίδης ὁ Ὀλόρου</i> Thucydides, son of Olorus.</p></li>
      <li id="item-4"><p>With locatives, as <i>οἱ Μαραθῶνι καὶ Σαλαμῖνι</i> those (who fought) at Marathon and Salamis, <i>τὰ οἴκοι</i> affairs, things at home.</p></li>
      <li id="item-5"><p>With adverbs, as <i>οἱ νῦν</i> the people of to-day, <i>οἱ τότε</i> those of that time, <i>οἱ ἐκεῖ</i> those over there.</p></li>
      <li id="item-6"><p>With prepositional phrases, as <i>οἱ ἐν τῷ ἄστει</i> those in the city, <i>τὰ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον</i> the things (needful) for the war.</p></li>
        <span class="page-break" id="p.205">[pg. 205]</span>
    
        
      <li id="item-7"><p>The neuter article is prefixed to any word or part of speech when considered merely as an expression, as <i>τὸ λέγει</i> the word “ <i>λέγει</i>,” <i>τὸ γνῶθι σεαυτόν</i> the (saying) &quot;know thyself.&quot;</p></li>
      <li id="item-8"><p>The neuter article in the singular, all cases, is used with the infinitive (articular infinitive), when emphasizing the substantive character of the infinitive. In this usage it is commonly translated by the English verbal noun in -ing, as <i>τὸ καλῶς μάχεσθαι</i> (the act of) fighting bravely, to fight bravely, <i>τὸ γράφειν</i> (nom.) writing, <i>τοῦ γράφειν</i> of writing, <i>τῷ γράφειν</i> to, or for writing, <i>τὸ γράφειν</i> (acc.) writing. <span>NOTE.</span> - The article is always thus used with the infinitive when the infinitive is construed with a preposition.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-487">
    <p><span>Verbal adjectives.</span> - In addition to verbal adjectives in <i>-τός</i>, as found in Homer and denoting possibility, or merely as the equivalent of the perfect passive participle, Attic Greek has a verbal adjective in <i>-τέος</i>, similarly formed, and used with <i>εἰμί</i> (often omitted), expressing necessity or duty, and admitting of two constructions:</p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li id="item-1"><p><span>Personal (passive) construction.</span> Only verbal nouns from transitive verbs can be thus employed, the verbal agreeing in gender and number with the subject. The agent is in the dative, as <i>ὠφελητέα σοι ἡ πόλις ἐστί</i> the state must be benefited by you, <i>οὐ πρό γε τῆς ἀληθείας τιμητέος ἀνήρ</i> a man must not be honored before the truth.</p></li>
      <li id="item-2"><p><span>Impersonal (active) construction.</span> In this construction, which is more frequent, the verbal is active in meaning and stands in the neuter nominative, usually singular, while its object is in the case which the finite verb would govern. The agent, if expressed, is usually in the dative, but is sometimes in the accusative as if dependent upon <i>δεῖ</i>, which has a meaning similar to that contained in these verbals, one must. Thus <i>ἀσκητέον σοι τὴν ἀρετήν</i> you must cultivate virtue, <i>τοὺς φίλους εὐεργετητέον, τὴν πόλιν ὠφελητέον, τῶν βοσκημάτων ἐπιμελητέον</i> one must do favors for one&#x27;s friends, benefit one&#x27;s state, and care for one&#x27;s cattle, <i>τὸν βουλόμενον εὐδαίμονα εἶναι σωφροσύνην διωκτέον καὶ ἀσκητέον</i> he who desires to be happy must pursue and cultivate temperance.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <span class="page-break" id="p.206">[pg. 206]</span>
  
  
  <section class="paragraph" id="div-488">
    <p><span><i>ἄν</i> in Attic.</span> - Attic, which does not employ <i>κέ(ν)</i>, has the following unhomeric uses of <i>ἄν</i>:</p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li id="item-1"><p>With past tenses, apparently as present conditional, as <i>πολλοῦ ἂν ἄξιον ἦν τὸ πλουτεῖν εἰ καὶ τὸ χαίρειν αὐτῷ συνῆν</i> it would be worth a great deal to be wealthy if joy were associated with it.</p></li>
      <li id="item-2"><p>With past tenses it takes the place of the iteratives in <i>-σκον</i>, which are not found in Attic Greek, as <i>ἔτρεπεν ἄν = τρέπεσκεν</i>, <i>ἔτρεψεν ἄν = τρέψασκεν</i>.</p></li>
      <li id="item-3"><p>The subjunctive with <i>av</i> is found in general statements which are valid also for the future, where English employs the indicative present, as <i>μαινόμεθα πάντες ὁπότ&#x27; ἂν ὀργιζώμεθα</i>, we are all mad when we are angry.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <p><span>Contraction</span>. — When one vowel follows another vowel in the same word, contraction sometimes (but not usually) takes place. When vowels are thus contracted, the following are the rules:</p>

          <li>Two like sounds unite in the common long sound, that is, two a-sounds (α), two e-sounds (ε, η), two i-sounds (ι), two o-sounds (ο, ω), or two u-sounds (υ), unite to form the common long (ᾱ, η, ῑ, ω, ῡ) sounds, except εε becomes ει, and oo becomes ου.</li>
          <li>An o-sound absorbs an a-sound or an e-sound and becomes long o (ω), except εο gives ευ, while οε becomes ου.</li>
          <li>If an a-sound comes together with an e-sound, the one which comes first absorbs the other and becomes long (ᾱ, η).</li>
          <li>A vowel coming before a diphthong beginning with the same vowel may be absorbed, and ε may be absorbed before οι. In other cases a vowel before a diphthong may be contracted with the first vowel of the diphthong, a following iota becoming iota subscript (<a class="reference" href="#n505505">505</a>), and a following υ disappearing.</li>

      <h3>INFLECTION</h3>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-626">
        <p>Inflection, including declension (nouns, adjectives, pronouns), comparison (adjectives, adverbs), and conjugation, is the fusion of a so-called stem (<a class="reference" href="#n630630">630</a>), and certain elements which express relationship to other words.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-627">
        <p>A root is the essential part of a word which remains after it has been analyzed into its various parts, and all prefixes, suffixes, and formative elements have been removed.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-628">
        <p>A stem often has more than one form, its different forms usually standing in ablaut (<a class="reference" href="#n593593">593</a>-<a class="reference" href="#n595595">595</a>) relation to each other. It is ordinarily derived from a root, by the addition of various formative elements, prefixes, and suffixes.</p>

      <section class="paragraph" id="div-629">
        <p>Some roots are also stems, and are combined directly with inflectional elements.</p>

        <p>An inflected word is in general made up of two parts :</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">

          <li>The inflectional element (usually an ending, commonly called a suffix; sometimes a prefix, as in the case of the augment, <a class="reference" href="#n830830">830</a>), which combines with the stem to form case, number, tense, person, etc.</li>

      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-633">
        <h3>Number</h3>
        <p>There are three numbers in Greek, the singular denoting one, the dual denoting two (usually referring to a pair of <span class="page-break" id="p.228">[pg. 228]</span> objects closely associated, or belonging together by nature and forming a closely related, unified group, as <i class="greek">χεῖρε, ὀφθαλμώ, ἵππω</i> <i>the two hands, eyes, horses</i>. Compare <i>yoke, team, pair</i> in English), and the plural denoting more than two.</p>
        <p>NOTE. - The plural is often used interchangeably with the dual to denote only two.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-634">
        <h3>Gender</h3>
        <p>There are three genders, the masculine, feminine, and neuter.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-635">
        <p>The gender must usually be learned by observation, but in general:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
          <li>1) The names of males are masculine.</li>
          <li>2) The names of females are feminine.</li>
          <li>3) The names of rivers, winds, and months are usually masculine.</li>
          <li>4) The names of countries, towns, trees, and islands are usually feminine.</li>
          <li>5) Most nouns denoting qualities and conditions are feminine.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-636">
        <p>A few nouns are used either as masculine or feminine, as <i class="greek">παῖς</i> <i>child</i>, which may be of either gender, and may mean either boy or girl, as may be required by occasion. Such words are said to be of common gender.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-637">
        <p>The demonstrative (often relative, or personal) pronoun most extensively used in the Homeric poems is <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i>, the first form being masculine, the second feminine, and the third neuter.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-638">
        <p>The form of the noun which appears in the vocabulary is the nominative singular, unless otherwise indicated. This is followed by the ending of the genitive singular, which denotes to which declension the noun belongs. After the ending of the genitive singular is placed the appropriate form of this pronoun, to indicate the gender. Thus <i class="greek">θεός, οῦ, ὁ</i> <i>god</i> is second declension masculine; <i class="greek">βουλή, ῆς, ἡ</i> <i>wish, will, plan</i> is first declension feminine, and <i class="greek">ἄλγος, εος, τό</i> <i>pain, woe</i> is third declension neuter.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-639">
        <h3>Cases</h3>
        <p>There are five cases in Greek, the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative, together with remnants of three lost cases, the locative, instrumental, and ablative (<a class="reference" href="#n657657">657</a>).</p>
      </section>
      <span class="page-break" id="p.229">[pg. 229]</span>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-640">
        <p>All these cases except the nominative and vocative are called oblique cases.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-641">
        <h3>Accent of Nouns</h3>
        <p>The accent of a noun usually remains in all the forms on the same syllable as in the nominative singular, or at least as near that syllable as the general rules of accent will allow. Thus <i class="greek">ἥρως</i> <i>hero</i> (nominative singular), but <i class="greek">ἡρώων</i> <i>of heroes</i> (genitive plural). See <a class="reference" href="#p544">544 ff.</a></p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-642">
        <p>Words monosyllabic in the nominative singular, when becoming dissyllabic by declension, regularly have the accent on the final syllable in all the dissyllabic forms of the genitive and dative of all numbers, and on the penult of the dual (trisyllabic), but keep the accent on the first syllable in all other cases.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-643">
        <p>An accented ultima in general takes the acute, but in the genitive and dative of all numbers a long ultima, if accented, takes the circumflex, as <i class="greek">ψυχή</i> <i>soul</i> (nom. sing.), but <i class="greek">ψυχῆς</i> <i>of a soul</i> (gen. sing.), <i class="greek">ψυχῇ</i> <i>to, for a soul</i> (dat. sing.), etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-644">
        <h3>Declensions</h3>
        <p>Nouns are declined in two general ways:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
          <li>1) The vowel declension, for stems (<a class="reference" href="#n630630">630</a>) ending in the pure vowels, <i class="greek">ᾱ, ο</i>.</li>
          <li>2) The consonant declension, for stems ending in a consonant, or the semi-vowels, <i class="greek">ι, υ</i>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-645">
        <p>The vowel declension has two forms, according as the noun stem ends in <i class="greek">α</i> or <i class="greek">ο</i>. Hence we have:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
          <li>1) The <i class="greek">α</i> declension, commonly called the first declension;</li>
          <li>2) The <i class="greek">ο</i> declension, commonly called the second declension.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-646">
        <p>The consonant declension, for stems ending in a semi-vowel (<i class="greek">ι, υ</i>, which were at times semi-consonantal) or a consonant, is commonly called the third declension.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="paragraph" id="div-647">
        <p>Words of the first declension have stems ending in <i class="greek">ᾱ</i>, which either becomes shortened in the nominative singular to <i class="greek">ᾰ</i>, or else becomes <i class="greek">η</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n621621">621</a>), except in the one word <i class="greek">θεά</i> <i>goddess</i>, and a very few proper names. Nouns of the first declension are either masculine or feminine.</p>

      <section class="paragraph" id="div-648">
        <h3>Case Endings</h3>
        <p>To form the various cases, numbers, and genders, the following case endings were fused with the stems of substantives and adjectives:</p>

  <h3>THE THIRD DECLENSION</h3>
  <p>Nouns of the third declension are masculine, feminine, and neuter.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-681">
  <p>There are many forms of the nominative of third declension nouns, which must be learned partly by practice, but in general:
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>Masculine and feminine stems, except those ending in <i class="greek">ν</i>, <i class="greek">ρ</i>, and <i class="greek">σ</i>, add <i class="greek">σ</i> to the stem and make the usual euphonic changes (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a>).</li>
      <li>Masculine and feminine stems ending in <i class="greek">ρ</i>, <i class="greek">σ</i> and most of those ending in <i class="greek">ν</i> make no change except to lengthen the last vowel if it is short, <i class="greek">ε</i> becoming <i class="greek">η</i> and <i class="greek">ο</i> becoming <i class="greek">ω</i>.</li>
      <li>Stems ending in <i class="greek">ν(τ)</i> either make no change except to lengthen the last vowel if it is short, dropping final <i class="greek">-τ</i> wherever it occurs, or else they add <i class="greek">σ</i> to the stem and make the usual euphonic changes (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a>), loss of <i class="greek">ν(τ)</i> and lengthening of the preceding vowel. Thus the stems: <i class="greek">δαιμον-</i>, <i class="greek">θῖν-</i>, <i class="greek">μελαν-</i>, <i class="greek">γεροντ-</i> give the nominatives <i class="greek">δαίμων</i> <i>divinity</i>, <i class="greek">θίς</i> <i>shore, beach</i>, <i class="greek">μέλᾶς</i> <i>black</i> and <i class="greek">γέρων</i> <i>old man</i>, respectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-682">
  <p>In neuters the nominative singular is usually the stem, with the exception of those with stems ending in <i class="greek">τ</i>, which is dropped wherever it occurs (<a class="reference" href="#n605605">605</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-683">
  <p>As a rule the stem of third declension nouns may be found by dropping the case ending (<i class="greek">-ος</i>) of the genitive singular.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-684">
  <p>The dative singular regularly ends in <i class="greek">ι</i>, but occasionally in <i class="greek">ι</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-685">
  <p>The accusative singular of masculine and feminine nouns is regularly formed by adding <i class="greek">ν</i> to stems ending in vowels and by adding <i class="greek">ν</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n597597">597</a>) to consonantal stems. <i class="greek">ν</i> of course regularly becomes <i class="greek">-ă</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n598598">598</a>, 4), thus making the case ending of accusatives singular masculine and feminine regularly <i class="greek">-ν</i> for vowel stems and <i class="greek">-ă</i> for consonantal stems.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.238">[pg. 238]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-686">
  <p>The dative plural is formed in two ways:
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>By adding <i class="greek">-εσσι</i> (rarely <i class="greek">-εσι</i>) to the stem.</li>
      <li>By adding <i class="greek">-σι</i> (rarely <i class="greek">-σσι</i>) to the stem.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-687">
  <p>NOTE. — When <i class="greek">-σι [-σσι]</i> is added, the preceding consonants are assimilated, or dropped, according to the rules (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a> ff.). Thus <i class="greek">πούς, ποδός, ὁ</i> <i>foot</i> gives <i class="greek">ποσ-σί</i> (from <i class="greek">ποδ-σι</i>), which may be further simplified to <i class="greek">ποσί</i>; <i class="greek">νύξ, νυκτός, ἡ</i> <i>night</i> gives <i class="greek">νυξί</i> (from <i class="greek">νυκτ-σι</i>); <i class="greek">γέρων, γέροντος, ὁ</i> <i>old man</i>, gives <i class="greek">γέρουσι</i> (from <i class="greek">γεροντ-σι</i>), etc. The longer forms of the datives of these nouns are <i class="greek">πόδεσσι, νύκτεσσι, γερόντεσσι</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-688">
  <p>The accusative plural of masculines and feminines originally ended in <i class="greek">-νς (-νς)</i>, which gives the ending <i class="greek">-ας</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n598598">598</a>, 4) for consonant stems, and <i class="greek">-ῖς, -ūs</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a> ff.) as the regular ending for the vowel stems.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-689">
  <p>NOTE. — A few vowel stems seem to have had <i class="greek">-as</i> in the accusative plural, formed by analogy from the consonantal stems.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-690">
  <p>Words ending in <i class="greek">-ις</i> and <i class="greek">-υς</i> in the nominative singular, but with dental mute (<i class="greek">τ, δ, θ</i>) stems very rarely drop the mute and take the accusative singular ending (<i class="greek">-ν</i>) of vowel stems.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-691">
  <p>The vocative singular is either the same as the nominative, or else the same as the stem, final consonants except <i class="greek">ν, ρ, σ</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n605605">605</a>) being dropped whenever they occur.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-692">
  <p>Compensative lengthening (<a class="reference" href="#n601601">601</a>) regularly takes place in the formation of the dative plural when <i class="greek">ντ</i> is thus dropped, but does not take place when only one letter, as <i class="greek">τ, δ, θ, σ, ν</i>, is dropped; as <i class="greek">πᾶσι (παντ-σι), γέρουσι (γεροντ-σι), δαίμοσι (δαιμον-σι)</i>.</p>

  <p>Irregular Nouns. — There are various types of irregularity in the formation and declension of nouns; the gender in the plural may be different from that in the singular; words may be declined from two separate stems (heteroclites), but have the same nominative singular; they may have cases formed from another stem than the nominative singular (metaplastic forms); or they may be used in only one case, or part of the cases (defectives). Irregular nouns can best be learned from the lexicon, as one meets them in reading and has occasion to use them. Most of them are very rare.</p>

  <p>Thematic and Athematic forms. — With respect to form Greek verbs fall into two main classes:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) <i class="greek">-ω</i> verbs, i.e. those ending in <i class="greek">-ω</i> in the first person singular, present active indicative, sometimes called thematic verbs (<a class="reference" href="#n796796">796</a>).</li>
    <li>2) <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs, i.e. those ending in <i class="greek">-μι</i> in the first person singular, present active indicative, sometimes called athematic verbs (<a class="reference" href="#n797797">797</a>).</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-796">
  <p>The thematic verbs are so named because in a majority of their forms the personal ending (<a class="reference" href="#p819-#p821">819-821</a>) is preceded by <i class="greek">ο/ε</i> (<i class="greek">ο</i> before <i class="greek">μ</i> or <i class="greek">ν</i>, or in the optative mode, otherwise <i class="greek">ε</i>), which is called the thematic vowel. Thus, <i class="greek">λυο/ε</i> (<i class="greek">λύω</i>) is called the theme, to which the personal endings (<a class="reference" href="#p819-#p821">819-821</a>) are attached.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-797">
  <p>Athematic verbs do not have this connecting vowel, but the personal endings are attached directly to the stem of the verb.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-798">
  <p>Many verbs which are regularly thematic may have athematic forms, as <i class="greek">δέχθαι</i>, <i class="greek">δέκτο</i> (<i class="greek">δέχομαι</i>); <i class="greek">λύμην</i>, <i class="greek">λύτο</i> (<i class="greek">λύω</i>); <i class="greek">ἆλτο</i> (<i class="greek">ἄλλομαι</i>), etc.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-799">
  <p>In the subjunctive these thematic vowels, <i class="greek">ο/ε</i>, are regularly long, being <i class="greek">ω/η</i> respectively.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-800">
  <p>In some cases the thematic vowel is short in the subjunctive, particularly in the dual and plural of the present and second aorist of <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs, the first aorist and second perfect of all verbs, and the second aorist of all verbs having athematic second aorists in the indicative.</p>

  <p>In the athematic inflection the final vowel of the tense stem is usually long (lengthened grade) in the singular, and commonly (but not always) is short (standing in ablaut relation (<a class="reference" href="#p593-#p595">593-595</a>), weakened or disappearing grade) in the dual and plural.

  <h3>PRIMARY ENDINGS OF THE ACTIVE VOICE (INDICATIVE AND SUBJUNCTIVE)</h3>
  <p>1 sing.: <i class="greek">-μι</i> is found in the present indicative of all <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs, and in a few subjunctives of <i class="greek">-ω</i> verbs. <i class="greek">-ω</i> is found in the present indicative of all <i class="greek">-ω</i> verbs, in all futures, and in the subjunctive. In the perfect indicative there is no personal ending, <i class="greek">-α</i> taking the place of the thematic vowel.</p>
  <p>2 sing.: <i class="greek">-σι</i> is found only in <i class="greek">ἐσσί</i> <i>you are</i>; elsewhere <i class="greek">-ς</i> has taken its place. <i class="greek">-θα (-σθα)</i> is used at times in the perfect, imperfect and pluperfect of the indicative, and occasionally in the subjunctive and optative.</p>
  <p>3 sing.: <i class="greek">-τι</i> is found only in <i class="greek">ἐστί</i> <i>he is</i>. It becomes <i class="greek">-σι</i> in the other <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs, and <i class="greek">-σι</i> is occasionally found in the subjunctive of <i class="greek">-ω</i> verbs. <i class="greek">-ω</i> verbs have another ending, <i class="greek">-ε</i>, of which the origin is uncertain. The perfect, <i class="greek">-ε</i>, has no personal ending.</p>
  <p>3 plur.: <i class="greek">-ντι</i> regularly becomes <i class="greek">-νσι</i>, and <i class="greek">ν</i> is then lost, with lengthening of the preceding vowel (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a>). Many <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs seem to have ended in <i class="greek">-αντι</i>, which first became <i class="greek">-ανσι</i>, and then <i class="greek">-ᾶσι</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n613613">613</a>). The perfect of consonant stems ended in <i class="greek">-ντι (-νσι)</i> which became <i class="greek">-ατι (-ασι)</i> and then <i class="greek">-ασι</i> (<a class="reference" href="#p597-#p598">597-8</a>). Generally <i class="greek">-ασι</i> in both present and perfect has been replaced by <i class="greek">-ᾶσι</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-825">
  <h3>SECONDARY ENDINGS OF THE ACTIVE (INDICATIVE AND OPTATIVE)</h3>
  <p>1 sing.: <i class="greek">-ν</i> after vowels remained unchanged; after consonants it became <i class="greek">-μ</i>, and then <i class="greek">-α</i> (<a class="reference" href="#p597-#p598">597-8</a>). Pluperfect <i class="greek">-εα</i> is usually contracted to <i class="greek">-η</i>. The optative has <i class="greek">-ν</i> when the mode suffix is <i class="greek">-ιη-</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n813813">813</a>); otherwise it has <i class="greek">-μι</i>.</p>
  <p>3 sing.: <i class="greek">-τ</i> is always dropped (<a class="reference" href="#n605605">605</a>); <i class="greek">ἔλυε</i> from <i class="greek">ἐλυετ</i>; cf. <i>amat</i>, <i class="greek">ἔλῦσε</i> has no personal ending; it takes its <i class="greek">-ε</i> from the perfect.</p>
  <p>2 dual: <i class="greek">-την</i> sometimes occurs instead of <i class="greek">-τον</i>.</p>
  <p>3 dual: <i class="greek">-τον</i> sometimes occurs instead of <i class="greek">-την</i>.</p>
  <span class="page-break" id="p.272">[pg. 272]</span>
  <p>3 plur.: <i class="greek">-ν</i> is for an earlier <i class="greek">-ντ</i>, <i class="greek">τ</i> being lost (<a class="reference" href="#n605605">605</a>), the vowel before it being regularly short. <i class="greek">-σαν</i>, from the first aorist ending, is used in the imperfect, and often in the second aorist of <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs, at times in the aorist passive, in the pluperfect active, and in the optative when it has the mode suffix <i class="greek">-ιη-</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-826">
  <h3>MIDDLE ENDINGS, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY (INDICATIVE, SUBJUNCTIVE, AND OPTATIVE)</h3>
  <p>2 sing.: <i class="greek">-σαι</i> drops its <i class="greek">σ</i> between vowels (<a class="reference" href="#n603603">603</a>), except in the perfect, and in the present indicative of <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs.</p>
  <p>2 sing.

In a few cases <i class="greek">σ</i> is dropped in the pluperfect.</p>
  <p>Dual: the first dual <i class="greek">-μεθον</i> is rare; <i class="greek">-σθον</i> occurs once instead of <i class="greek">-σθην</i>.</p>
  <p>3 plur.: <i class="greek">-νται</i>, <i class="greek">-ντο</i> regularly become <i class="greek">-αται</i>, <i class="greek">-ατο</i> (<i class="greek">-νται, -ντο</i>) in the perfect and pluperfect of verbs with consonant stems, stems ending in <i class="greek">-ι</i>, occasionally in vowel stems, and always in the optative. Elsewhere occasionally <i class="greek">-νται</i>, <i class="greek">-ντο</i> become <i class="greek">-αται</i>, <i class="greek">-ατο</i> (<a class="reference" href="#p597-#p598">597-8</a>).</p>

  <p>2 sing. active: <i class="greek">-ε</i> of the second sing. is the thematic vowel, and forms like <i class="greek">λύε</i>, <i class="greek">ἄειδε</i> have no personal ending. <i class="greek">-θι</i> is common, with both an active and passive meaning. In the first aorist passive <i class="greek">-θι</i> becomes <i class="greek">-τι</i> after <i class="greek">-θη-</i> of the passive stem (<a class="reference" href="#n619619">619</a>). <i class="greek">-ς</i> occurs in a few cases. The endings of the aorist, <i class="greek">-σον</i> (active) and <i class="greek">-σαι</i> (middle) are obscure.</p>
  <p>2 sing. middle: <i class="greek">-σο</i> loses its <i class="greek">σ</i> between vowels (<a class="reference" href="#n603603">603</a>), except in the perfect of all verbs and the pres. of <i class="greek">-μι</i> verbs.</p>

  <p>Second Tenses. — Many verbs have what are called second tenses, as second aorists (active, middle, and passive), and second perfects and pluperfects (active). These second tenses are irregular in formation, and are thus named to distinguish them from the more common, regularly formed tenses, which are called first tenses.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-864">
  <p>The meaning of these second tenses ordinarily corresponds to that of the first tenses, except in the comparatively few cases when a verb has both forms. Then the first and second tenses may differ slightly in meaning, usually by the first being transitive (sometimes causative), the second intransitive. Compare the Americanism <i>shine, shined, shined</i>, used transitively, as in the expression &quot;he shined my shoes,&quot; with the more common forms of the verb, <i>shine, shone, shone</i>, used intransitively, as &quot;the sun shone.&quot; &quot;Shined&quot; may be compared in form and meaning to a first aorist, while &quot;shone&quot; would correspond in form and meaning to a second aorist. Thus in Greek, <i class="greek">ἔβην</i> (2d aor.) signifies <i>I went, walked</i> (intransitive), while <i class="greek">ἔβησα</i> (1st aor.) signifies <i>I caused to go, walked</i> (transitive), as in English <i>I walked my horse</i> (<i class="greek">ἔβησα ἵππον</i>) i.e. <i>I caused my horse to walk</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-865">
  <p>Second aorists are formed in various ways:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) A common method is for them to have the secondary (<a class="reference" href="#n816816">816</a>) endings, following the thematic vowel <i class="greek">ο/ε</i>, thus being conjugated like the imperfect, as <i class="greek">ἔχω, ἕξω, ἔσχον</i> <i>to have</i>, where <i class="greek">ἔσχον</i> the second aorist is conjugated like <i class="greek">ἔλυον</i>, the imperfect of <i class="greek">λύω</i> <i>to loose</i>.</li>
    <li>2) Many have the secondary endings attached directly to the tense stem, and thus are conjugated like the aorist passive, but without the <i class="greek">θ</i> of the passive stem. Thus <i class="greek">ἔβην</i> (<i class="greek">βαίνω</i>), <i class="greek">ἔδῦν</i> (<i class="greek">δύω</i>), <i class="greek">ἔγνων</i> (<i class="greek">γιγνώσκω</i>), etc. These are athematic (<a class="reference" href="#n797797">797</a>) of course.</li>
    <li>3) Others end in <i class="greek">-α</i> and are conjugated with the same endings as the first (regular) aorists, but without the <i class="greek">σ</i>, as <i class="greek">εἶπα, ἔκηα</i>.</li>

  <p>The subject of a finite verb is in the nominative case, as <i class="greek">ὀλέκοντο δὲ λαοί</i> <i>and the people kept perishing</i>, <i class="greek">ἔδεισεν δ᾽ ὁ γέρων</i> <i>and that old man feared</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-971">
  <p>The subject of an infinitive is regularly in the accusative, as <i class="greek">ἄμμε ὀἴω ἄψ ἀπονοστήσειν</i> <i>I think we shall return home</i>, <i class="greek">βούλομ᾽ ἐγὼ λαὸν σόον ἔμμεναι</i> <i>I wish my people to be safe</i>. The subject of the infinitive is usually omitted when it is the same as the subject or object, either direct or indirect, of the main verb.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-972">
  <p>When the infinitive is used to express a command (<a class="reference" href="#p1107">1107, 11</a>), its subject, when expressed, is in the nominative when of the second person, and in the accusative when of the third person, as <i class="greek">σὺ τόν γ᾽ ἐπέεσσι καθάπτεσθαι μαλακοῖσιν</i> <i>but do you attack him with soft words</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-973">
  <p>A finite verb regularly agrees with its subject nominative in person and number, except:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) A neuter plural subject may take its verb in the singular, as <i class="greek">ᾤχετο κῆλα θεοῖο</i> <i>the shafts of the god sped</i>, <i class="greek">τὰ δέδασται</i> <i>these have been distributed</i>.</li>
    <li>2) With two or more subjects connected by and, the verb may agree with one of the subjects and be understood with the rest, as <i class="greek">μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμῃ σκῆπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοῖο</i> <i>lest the sceptre and the fillet of the god avail thee naught</i>, <i class="greek">εἰ δὴ ὁμοῦ πόλεμός τε δαμᾷ καὶ λοιμὸς Ἀχαιούς</i> <i>if war and pestilence at the same time crush the Achaeans</i>.</li>
    <li>3) When referring to two, the plural and dual are often interchanged or united, as <i class="greek">δεινὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε φάανθεν</i> <i>and her eyes appeared terrible</i>, <i class="greek">τώ οἱ ἔσαν κήρυκε καὶ ὀτρηρὼ θεράποντε</i> <i>who were his two heralds and ready attendants</i>, <i class="greek">τὼ δ᾽ αὐτὼ μάρτυροι ἔστων</i> <i>and let these two be witnesses</i>.</li>

<section class="paragraph" id="div-976">
  <p>The verb <i class="greek">εἰμί</i> (especially the forms of the third person singular and plural <i class="greek">ἐστί, εἰσί</i>) is often omitted, when it can easily be supplied from the context.</p>

  <h3>Genitive Case</h3>
  <p>The Greek genitive represents two earlier cases (<a class="reference" href="#n657657">657</a>):</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) the genitive proper, denoting the class to which a person or thing belongs.</li>
    <li>2) the ablatival genitive (formerly the ablative), usually expressing separation, source, cause.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-979">
  <p>Some of the most common uses of the genitive are:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li><span>1) Possession</span>, as <i class="greek">ψυχὰς ἡρώων</i> <i>souls of warriors</i>, <i class="greek">Διὸς βουλή</i> <i>the will of Zeus</i>, <i class="greek">ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν</i> <i>to the ships of the Achaeans</i>: the possessive genitive.</li>
    <li><span>2) The subject of an action or feeling</span>, as <i class="greek">μῆνιν Ἀχιλῆος</i> <i>the wrath of Achilles</i> (i.e. felt by Achilles): the subjective genitive.</li>
    <li><span>3) The object of an action or feeling</span>, as <i class="greek">Ἀχιλλῆος ποθή</i> <i>a yearning of (i.e. for) Achilles</i>, <i class="greek">πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἔρον</i> <i>the desire of (i.e. for) food and drink</i>: the objective genitive.</li>
    <span class="page-break" id="p.315">[pg. 315]</span>

    <li><span>5) Measure of time, space, or value (price)</span>, as <i class="greek">κούρης Χρυσηίδος ἄποινα δέξασθαι</i> <i>to accept the ransoms for the maiden Chryseïs</i>: genitive of price.</li>
    <li><span>6) Cause or origin</span>, as <i class="greek">εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται</i> <i>he finds fault on account of a vow (unperformed)</i>, <i class="greek">χωόμενον γυναικός</i> <i>vexed for the sake of a woman</i>: the genitive of cause.</li>

  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-980">
  <p>The partitive genitive may follow all adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and participles, which denote a part, as <i class="greek">οἰωνοπόλων ὄχ᾽ ἄριστος</i> <i>far the best of augurs</i>, <i class="greek">οἷος Ἀργείων</i> <i>alone of the Argives</i>, <i class="greek">τῶν δ᾽ ἄλλων οὔ τις ὁρᾶτο</i> <i>but not any one of the others saw her</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-981">
  <p>A genitive in the predicate after verbs meaning to be, etc., and other copulative verbs, may express any of the relations of the attributive genitive (<a class="reference" href="#p979">979, 1-7</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-982">
  <p>Any verb whose action affects the object in part only, or which means to share, or to enjoy, may take the genitive, as <i class="greek">ἀρνῶν κνίσης αἰγῶν τε τελείων ἀντιάσας</i> <i>having partaken of the fat of unblemished lambs and goats</i>, <i class="greek">ἵνα πάντες ἐπαύρωνται βασιλῆος</i> <i>in order that all may reap the benefits of their king</i>.</p>

<section class="paragraph" id="div-983">
  <p>Verbs meaning to begin, make trial of, take hold of, touch, attain, claim, aim, hit, miss, take the genitive, as <i class="greek">κόμης ἕλε Πηλεΐωνα</i> <i>she grabbed Achilles by the hair of his head</i>, <i class="greek">λαβὲ γούνων</i> <i>lay hold of his knees</i>, <i class="greek">χειρὸς ἑλόντε</i> <i>having taken hold of her hand</i>, <i class="greek">ποδὸς τεταγών</i> <i>having seized me by the foot</i>.</p>

<section class="paragraph" id="div-984">
  <p>Verbs signifying to taste, smell, hear, perceive, comprehend, remember, forget, desire, care for, spare, neglect, wonder at, admire, despise, take the genitive, as <i class="greek">κλῦθί μευ</i> <i>hear me!</i> <i class="greek">σέθεν δ᾽ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀλεγίζω οὐδ᾽ ὄθομαι κοτέοντος</i> <i>I reck not of thee, nor am I concerned at thine anger</i>, <i class="greek">κήδετο Δαναῶν</i> <i>she grieved for the Danaans</i>, <i class="greek">καὶ μέν μευ βουλέων ξύνιεν</i> <i>and they hearkened to my advice</i>, <i class="greek">τῶν μιν μνήσασα</i> <i>having reminded him of this</i>, <i class="greek">Θέτις οὐ λήθετ᾽ ἐφετμέων</i> <i>Thetis did not forget the behests</i>.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.316">[pg. 316]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-985">
  <p>The genitive follows verbs signifying to rule, lead, direct, as <i class="greek">ὃς Τενέδοιο ἀνάσσεις</i> <i>(thou) who dost rule Tenedos</i>, <i class="greek">ὃς πάντων Ἀργείων κρατέει</i> <i>who rules all the Argives</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-986">
  <p>Verbs signifying fulness and want take the genitive of material (<a class="reference" href="#p979">979, 4</a>). Those meaning to fill take the accusative of the thing filled, and the genitive of material, as <i class="greek">μένεος φρένες πίμπλαντο</i> <i>his diaphragm was filled with rage</i>, <i class="greek">κοῦροι κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο</i> <i>the young men filled the mixing bowls to the brim with drink</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-987">
  <p>The genitive may denote that from which anything is separated or distinguished (genitive of separation); hence it is used after verbs meaning remove, restrain, release, cease, fail, differ, give up, etc., as <i class="greek">λῆγ᾽ ἔριδος</i> <i>cease from strife</i>, <i class="greek">πολέμου δ᾽ ἀποπαύεο</i> <i>but refrain from war</i>. It is used also to denote source, as <i class="greek">δεινὴ κλαγγὴ γένετ᾽ ἀργυρέοιο βιοῖο</i> <i>a terrifying clang arose from the silver bow</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-988">
  <p>The genitive follows verbs signifying surpass, be inferior to, and all others which imply a comparison (<a class="reference" href="#n993993">993</a>), as <i class="greek">Κλυταιμνήστρης προβέβουλα</i> <i>I prefer (her) to Clytaemnestra</i>, <i class="greek">περὶ πάντων ἔμμεναι ἄλλων</i> <i>to be above all others</i>, <i class="greek">οἳ περὶ βουλὴν Δαναῶν ἐστε</i> <i>(you) who surpass the Danaans in counsel</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-989">
  <p>Verbs compounded with a preposition are often followed by the genitive, as <i class="greek">τὰ πολίων ἐξεπράθομεν</i> <i>(whatsoever) we took as spoil from the cities</i>, <i class="greek">περίσχεο παιδός</i> <i>protect your son</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-990">
  <p>The genitive may denote time within which anything takes place.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-991">
  <p>Many adjectives kindred in meaning or derivation to verbs which take the genitive are followed by the genitive (objective).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-992">
  <p>Many adverbs, chiefly those of place, and those derived from adjectives which take the genitive, are construed with the genitive, as <i class="greek">τηλόθι πάτρης</i> <i>far from her native land</i>, <i class="greek">πάροιθ᾽ αὐτοῖο</i> <i>in front of him</i>, <i class="greek">λιμένος ἐντός</i> <i>within the harbor</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-993">
  <p>Adjectives and adverbs of the comparative degree take the genitive (<a class="reference" href="#n988988">988</a>), unless followed by <i class="greek">ἤ (ἠέ)</i> <i>than</i>, as <i class="greek">οὔ ἑθέν ἐστι χερείων</i> <i>she is not inferior to her</i> (literally <i>not worse than</i>), <i class="greek">φέρτερός εἰμι σέθεν</i> <i>I am mightier than you</i>, <i class="greek">γλυκίων μέλιτος</i> <i>sweeter than honey</i>.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.317">[pg. 317]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-994">
  <p>A noun and a participle not closely connected grammatically with the rest of the sentence may stand by themselves in the genitive. This construction is called the genitive absolute. Examples: <i class="greek">αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος</i> <i>as the god moved</i>, <i class="greek">ἐμεῦ ζῶντος καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο</i> <i>while I live and look out upon the earth</i>.</p>

  <h3>Dative Case</h3>
  <p>The Greek dative represents three earlier cases (<a class="reference" href="#n657657">657</a>):</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) the dative proper, denoting to or for which something is or is done.</li>
    <li>2) the instrumental (dative), denoting instrument, means, manner, cause, accompaniment.</li>
    <li>3) the locative (dative), denoting place where and time when.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-995">
  <p>The indirect object of a transitive verb is in the dative, as <i class="greek">τήν οἱ πόρε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων</i> <i>which Phoebus Apollo granted to him</i>, <i class="greek">πῶς τοι δώσουσι γέρας</i> <i>how shall they give you a prize of honor?</i></p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-996">
  <p>Many verbs which in English are transitive are intransitive in Greek and take the dative. The verbs of this class are mainly those meaning serve, benefit, defend, assist, please, obey, trust, satisfy, advise, exhort, and their opposites; also those signifying abuse, anger, blame, envy, friendliness, hostility, reproach, threats, etc., as <i class="greek">βασιλῆι χολωθείς</i> <i>incensed at the king</i>, <i class="greek">οὐκ Ἀτρεΐδῃ ἤνδανε θυμῷ</i> <i>it was not pleasing to the son of Atreus in his soul</i>, <i class="greek">μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμῃ σκῆπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοῖο</i> <i>lest the sceptre and the fillet of the god avail thee not</i>; <i class="greek">ἐπείθετο μύθῳ</i> <i>he obeyed the command</i>, <i class="greek">μοί ἀρήξειν</i> <i>to defend me</i>, <i class="greek">ὅτε χώσεται ἀνδρὶ χέρηι</i> <i>when he becomes enraged at an inferior</i>, <i class="greek">ἀπειλήσω δέ τοι ὧδε</i> <i>and I shall threaten you as follows</i>, <i class="greek">μήνι Ἀχαιοῖσιν</i> <i>continue to rage against the Achaeans</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-997">
  <p>A person or thing for whose advantage or disadvantage a thing exists or is done is put in the dative, as <i class="greek">αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν οἰωνοῖσί τε δαῖτα</i> <i>and it made themselves a booty for the dogs and a banquet for the birds</i>, <i class="greek">παῖδα δ᾽ ἐμοὶ λύσαι</i> <i>but free for me my child</i>, <i class="greek">τόδε μοι κρήηνον ἐέλδωρ</i> <i>accomplish for me this desire</i>, <i class="greek">ἡμῖν ἀπὸ λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι</i> <i>to ward off destruction for (from) us</i>, <i class="greek">καὶ δή μοι γέρας αὐτὸς ἀφαιρήσεσθαι ἀπειλεῖς</i> <i>and you threaten to take away for (from) me my prize of honor</i>, <i class="greek">Ἀχιλλῆι μεθέμεν χόλον</i> <i>to forego (your) anger for Achilles</i>, <i class="greek">σὺν δ᾽ ἡμῖν δαῖτα ταράξῃ</i> <i>and he should throw the banquet into confusion for us</i>.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.318">[pg. 318]</span>

  <p>The dative of interest or reference denotes the person to whose case a statement is limited.</p>

              <h3>Accusative Case</h3>
   <section class="paragraph" id="div-1011">

  <p>The direct object of a transitive verb is in the accusative case, as <i class="greek">νοῦσον ὦρσε</i> <i>he roused a plague</i>, <i class="greek">Χρύσην ἠτίμασεν</i> <i>he dishonored Chryses</i>, <i class="greek">λυσόμενος θύγατρα</i> <i>to ransom his own daughter</i>, <i class="greek">φέρων ἄποινα</i> <i>bearing ransoms</i>, <i class="greek">στέμματ᾽ ἔχων</i> <i>having fillets</i>, <i class="greek">ἐλίσσετο Ἀχαιούς</i> <i>he kept entreating the Achaeans</i>.</p>

<section class="paragraph" id="div-1012">
  <p>Any verb whose meaning permits may take an accusative of cognate form, or equivalent meaning. This is called the cognate accusative, and may follow intransitive as well as transitive verbs, as <i class="greek">εἶπας ἔπος</i> <i>you have spoken a word</i>, <i class="greek">ὁδὸν ἐλθέμεναι</i> <i>to go (on) a journey</i>, <i class="greek">ἔπος τ᾽ ἔφατο</i> <i>and she spoke a word</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1013">
  <p>The words <i class="greek">ἔπος, μῦθος</i>, and <i class="greek">ἔργον</i> with pronouns or adjectives are at times practically equivalent to the neuter of the pronoun or adjective without these words, as <i class="greek">εἴ σοι πᾶν ἔργον ὑπείξομαι</i> <i>if I shall yield to you in every matter</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1014">
  <p>An accusative restricting the force of the verb to a part, character, quality, or attribute of the subject may follow many verbs that are intransitive or reflexive in meaning. This is the accusative of the part affected, or accusative of specification, and may also accompany a noun, an adjective, or even a whole sentence, as <i class="greek">πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς</i> <i>swift-footed Achilles</i> (literally <i>Achilles swift with respect to his feet</i>), <i class="greek">χωόμενος κῆρ</i> <i>enraged in heart</i>, <i class="greek">οὔ ἑθέν ἐστι χερείων, οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν οὔτ᾽ ἂρ φρένας οὐδέ τι ἔργα</i> <i>she is not inferior to her, neither in build nor beauty nor disposition, nor yet in accomplishments</i>.</p>

  <p>The accusative may be used of the person about whom a thing is told, known, thought, or provided:</p>

  <p>An adjective agrees with its noun in gender, number, and case, but not always in form, since they may belong to different declensions, as <i class="greek">νοῦσος κακή</i> <i>an evil plague</i>, where <i class="greek">νοῦσος</i>, although feminine, is of the second declension and ends in <i class="greek">-ος</i>.

      <section class="textpart">
<h3>Pronouns</h3>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1028">
  <h3>The Pronoun <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i></h3>
  <p>There are three chief uses of the pronoun, <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i>:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) As an independent demonstrative (and third personal) pronoun, meaning this, that, he, she, it. This is its original use, and the one most commonly met with in Homer, as <i class="greek">ὁ νοῦσον ὦρσε</i> <i>he roused a plague</i>, <i class="greek">τὸν Χρύσην ἠτίμασεν ἀρητῆρα Ἀτρεΐδης</i> <i>the son of Atreus dishonored that (well-known) Chryses, the priest</i>, <i class="greek">τὴν δ᾽ ἐγὼ οὐ λύσω</i> <i>but I will not free her</i>, <i class="greek">ἔδεισεν δ᾽ ὁ γέρων</i> <i>and that old man feared</i>.</li>
    <li>2) As an article properly speaking (&quot;the&quot;), that is, modifying and making definite a noun, but not having any particular demonstrative force. This is its ordinary use in Greek after Homer.</li>
    <li>3) As a relative pronoun, as <i class="greek">τὸν τέκε Λητώ</i> <i>whom Leto bore</i>, <i class="greek">τώ οἱ ἔσαν κήρυκε</i> <i>who were his two heralds</i>, <i class="greek">τήν μοι δόσαν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν</i> <i>whom the sons of the Achaeans gave unto me</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="tooltip"><sup class="tooltip-marker">[*]</sup><span class="tooltip-text">Many expressions in Homer which are translated into English by the relative pronoun in a subordinate clause seem to have been coördinate originally. Thus the pronoun (<i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i>) in these last three sentences may well have been thought of as demonstrative with asyndeton rather than as relative, <a class="reference" href="#p1113-#p1114">1113–1114</a>.</span></span>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1029">
  <p>As an independent pronoun it has two main uses:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) It is &quot;resumptive,&quot; that is, it refers to something already mentioned, <i class="greek">Χρύσην ἠτίμασεν, ὁ γὰρ ἦλθε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας</i> <i>he dishonored Chryses, for he came to the swift ships</i>.</li>
    <span class="page-break" id="p.324">[pg. 324]</span>
    <li>2) It makes a contrast, usually in combinations, such as <i class="greek">ὁ μὲν ... ὁ δέ</i>, and other words which help to give this effect.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1030">
  <p><span><span>ὁ μὲν ... ὁ δέ</span></span> and <i class="greek">οἱ μὲν ... οἱ δέ</i> are frequently used to contrast both definite and indefinite persons and things.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1031">
  <p>Its use with an adversative particle generally, but not always, marks a change of subject, as <i class="greek">ὁ δέ</i> <i>but the other</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1032">
  <p>The use of <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i> as an article has evidently arisen from its employment as an independent pronoun, followed by a noun in apposition, as <i class="greek">ἡ δ᾽ ἀέκουσα ἅμα τοῖσι γυνὴ κίεν</i> <i>but she went with them against her will, i.e. the woman</i>, where <i class="greek">γυνή</i> is added as an afterthought for the sake of greater definiteness.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1033">
  <p>So also it may serve to introduce a new person, in this case anticipating the noun, as <i class="greek">αὐτὰρ ὁ μήνιε νηυσὶ παρήμενος διογενὴς Πηλῆος υἱὸς πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς</i> <i>but he kept raging as he sat beside the ships, did the Zeus-born son of Peleus, the swift-footed Achilles</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1034">
  <p>With the adjective or participle it is often used as a substantive, as <i class="greek">τὸ πλεῖον</i> <i>the greater part</i>, <i class="greek">τὰ κακά</i> <i>these calamities, such calamities</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n10271027">1027</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1035">
  <p>It is also used with the neuter accusative, singular or plural, of the adjective as an adverb, as <i class="greek">τὰ πρῶτα</i> <i>at first</i> (<a class="reference" href="#p780-#p781">780-781</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1036">
  <p>On the other hand, the masculine or feminine with an adverb may be used substantively.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1037">
  <p>Nouns with a possessive pronoun take the article only when they refer to a definite individual, as <i class="greek">τὸ σὸν μένος</i> <i>this anger of yours</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1038">
  <p>It usually has a demonstrative force, and its absence does not mark a noun as indefinite, as <i class="greek">μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος</i> <i>sing, goddess, the wrath of the son of Peleus, Achilles</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1039">
  <h3>The Personal Pronouns</h3>
  <p>The nominative of the personal pronouns is used mainly for emphasis and contrast, as <i class="greek">σὺ δὲ σύνθεο</i> <i>but do you consider</i>. If the subject is unemphatic, the pronoun is usually omitted, as <i class="greek">ὡς ἔφατο</i> <i>thus he spoke</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n761761">761</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1040">
  <p>The oblique cases of the third personal pronoun are anaphoric, that is, they have an antecedent previously expressed to which they refer, when unaccented; but when they are accented they have their original reflexive use, as <i class="greek">ἀπὸ ἕο κάββαλεν υἱόν</i> <i>she hurled her son from her</i>, <i class="greek">καί οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί</i> <i>and the Achaeans trust in him</i>.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.325">[pg. 325]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1041">
  <h3>Demonstrative Pronouns</h3>
  <p>The demonstrative pronouns are thus distinguished:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) <i class="greek">(ἐ)κεῖνος, η, ο</i> is used of something remote from the speaker.</li>
    <li>2) <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i> differs from <i class="greek">οὗτος, (ἐ)κεῖνος, ὅδε</i>, etc., in that it usually marks a contrast in objects, but does not distinguish them as near and far, present and absent, etc.</li>
    <li>3) The compounds of <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i> are used of something near the speaker, or of something associated with him.</li>
    <li>4) <i class="greek">οὗτος</i> is used of something which has been mentioned already, or else of something of particular interest or concern to the second person.</li>
    <li>5) <i class="greek">ὁ, ἡ, τό</i> in addition to being employed as a relative and as a personal pronoun is used to mark a contrast.</li>
    <li>6) <i class="greek">αὐτός</i> in all its cases regularly means <i>self</i>, but at times may mean <i>same</i>; it is regularly intensive and is used especially to contrast a man or an object with other less important details, as clothing, weapons, and appurtenances of various kinds.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1042">
  <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>
  <p>The possessive pronouns are as a rule equivalent to the possessive genitive of the personal pronoun, as <i class="greek">παῖς ἐμός = παῖς ἐμοῦ</i> <i>my child</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1043">
  <h3>The Interrogative Pronouns</h3>
  <p>The interrogative <i class="greek">τίς, τί</i> <i>who? which? what?</i> may be either substantive or adjective, and may be used in either direct or indirect questions.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1044">
  <h3>The Indefinite Pronoun</h3>
  <p>The indefinite <i class="greek">τὶς, τὶ</i> <i>some (one), something, any (one), anything</i> may be either substantive or adjective, but is sometimes almost the equivalent of the English indefinite article, <i>a(n)</i>, as <i class="greek">τινὰ μάντιν ἐρείομεν</i> <i>let us ask a seer</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1045">
  <h3>Relative Pronouns</h3>
  <p>A relative agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, but its case depends upon the construction of the clause in which it stands, as <i class="greek">μῆνιν ἄειδε, ἣ ἄλγε᾽ ἔθηκεν</i> <i>sing the wrath which caused woes</i>.</p>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.326">[pg. 326]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1046">
  <p>The antecedent of the relative may be omitted when it can easily be supplied from the context, especially when it is indefinite, as <i class="greek">λώιόν ἐστι δῶρ᾽ ἀποαιρεῖσθαι, ὅστις σέθεν ἀντίον εἴπῃ</i> <i>it is better to take away the gifts (of that man) whoever speaks against you</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1047">
  <p>The antecedent is sometimes attracted into the relative clause. It then agrees in case with the relative.</p>

      <section class="textpart">
         <h3>General</h3> 
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1062">
  <p>A transitive verb is one whose action passes over to an object in the accusative, as <i class="greek">μῆνιν ἄειδε</i> <i>sing the wrath</i>, <i class="greek">ἐλίσσετο Ἀχαιούς</i> <i>he kept entreating the Achaeans</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1063">
  <p>An intransitive verb is one whose action does not pass over to an object, as <i class="greek">ἦλθε</i> <i>he came</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1064">
  <p>In verbs with both first and second tenses (first aorist, second aorist, first perfect, second perfect, etc.), the first tense is usually transitive (often causative, <a class="reference" href="#n10691069">1069</a>), the second intransitive.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1065">
  <p>The active voice denotes the subject as acting, as <i class="greek">νοῦσον ἀνὰ στρατὸν ὦρσε</i> <i>he kindled a plague up through the camp</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1066">
  <p>The passive voice denotes the subject as being acted upon, as <i class="greek">Διὸς δ᾽ ἐτελείετο βουλή</i> <i>but the will of Zeus was being accomplished</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1067">
  <p>The middle voice denotes the subject as acting reflexively:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    <li>1) upon itself, as <i class="greek">πείθομαι</i> <i>I persuade myself (obey)</i>, <i class="greek">φαίνομαι</i> <i>I show myself (appear)</i>.</li>
    <li>2) for itself, as <i class="greek">καλέομαι</i> <i>I call for myself, summon</i>.</li>
    <li>3) upon something belonging to itself, or in which it has a special interest, as <i class="greek">λύομαι</i> <i>I loose my own, ransom</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1068">
  <p>It is often difficult to distinguish in translation between the active and middle, but the action of the middle always has some reference, either direct or indirect, to the subject, and the subject has an interest in, or is affected by the action.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1069">
  <p>Some verbs are used at times in a causative sense, that is, the subject causes something to be done by another, as <i class="greek">ἂν δ᾽ αὐτὴν Χρυσηίδα βήσομεν</i> <i>let us cause Chryseïs to go on board</i> (<a class="reference" href="#n864864">864</a>).</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1070">
  <p>Sometimes the present tense indicates that an action is only attempted; this is called the conative present, as <i class="greek">ἀρνύμενος</i> <i>striving to win</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1071">
  <p>When an active verb which takes two accusatives (<a class="reference" href="#n10201020">1020</a>) becomes passive, the accusative of the thing is retained, while the accusative of the person becomes the subject, as <i class="greek">ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένε</i> <i>O thou clothed in shamelessness!</i></p>

  <h3>Inceptive aorist</h3>
  <p>The aorist of verbs denoting a state or a condition, or continued action, usually denotes the entrance into the state, or the beginning of the action, as <i class="greek">ἐδάκρυσε</i> <i>he fell to weeping</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1082">
  <p>The aorist is often used to express a general truth. It is then called a gnomic aorist, and is considered a primary tense, as <i class="greek">ὅς κε θεοῖς ἐπιπείθηται, μάλα τ᾽ ἔκλυον αὐτοῦ</i> <i>whoever obeys the gods, him they especially hear</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1083">
  <p>The future ordinarily denotes that an action will take place later; but may express desire or a command.</p>

    <h3>Moods</h3>      
    <section class="paragraph" id="div-1085">
  <p>The adverbs <i class="greek">ἄν</i> and <i class="greek">κέ(ν)</i> are often used to qualify the meaning of the moods; they are used in two ways:</p>
  <ul class="simple-list">

  </ul>
</section>
<span class="page-break" id="p.330">[pg. 330]</span>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1086">
  <p>These adverbs usually give a touch of indefiniteness to the clause in which they stand. They have no exact equivalent in English. When they appear in the conclusion of conditional sentences, they are usually translated by <i>could</i>, or <i>would</i>, in English.</p>
</section>
<section class="paragraph" id="div-1087">
  <p>The subjunctive with these adverbs is used almost the same as the future indicative, or the potential optative (<a class="reference" href="#n11051105">1105</a>).</p>

    <li>7) The infinitive may be the subject of a verb, especially an impersonal one, or <i class="greek">ἐστί(ν)</i>.</li>
    <li>8) It may be the object of a verb, especially verbs indicating wish, command, advice, consent, attempt, and the like.</li>
